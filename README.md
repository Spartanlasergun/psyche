# psyche

I am a psychology student (currently pursuing my master's degree). Occasionally I go online and collect data on problems that I need a bit of clarity with. I intend to post an review some of these datasets here. While it does not constitute academic research it most definitely is interesting. The raw datasets are provided so you can gloss over the individual responses to get a sense of the information the way that I have. Relevant graphs, ipython notebooks and a general discussion of what the data has indicated is also given. Enjoy!
