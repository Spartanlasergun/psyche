# psyche

I am a psychology student (currently pursuing my master's degree). Occasionally, I go online and collect data on problems that I need a bit of clarity with. I intend to post an review some of these datasets here. The raw datasets are provided along with relevant graphs and ipython notebooks. A general discussion of what the data has indicated is also given. Enjoy!
