What is your gender?,"Shakespeare famously said, that ""all is fair in love and war."" Do you agree with this?","Consider the following situation:
John is attracted to a woman named Rebecca. John's friend Mark is also interested in Rebecca. Rebecca is extremely beautiful. If John were to begin a relationship with Rebecca, all of his friends would be envious of him including Mark who has strong feelings for her. There is another problem. John knows that his family would not approve of Rebecca because of her skin color. John is unsure of how to proceed. Rebecca has already indicated that she is attracted to him and if John would like to begin a relationship with her all he has to do is tell her how he feels. 
What are your thoughts on this situation? (Be as detailed as you like in your response.)",What are some of the things that people should consider when pursuing a romantic relationship with someone else? (Be as detailed as you like in your response)
Male,Yes,"I think John should talk to Mark who is his best friend, if he finds out that he is also attracted to her, and thus avoid conflicts in the long term, I think the John family should meet Rebecca before judging her for the color of her skin and the same John on that subject a few days before with his family ","That both parties have to accept themselves as they are, support each other in any situation that life places on them, help each other, talk about their problems and situations "
Male,Maybe,"L’amour est plus fort que les préjugés racistes .
Si ce n’est pas le cas,  c’est que ce n’est pas de l’amour . C’est simples","Soyez vous même et naturel 
Ne mentez pas et pensez au bien être de l’autre"
Male,Yes,"True friends are a rare breed, John should let mark know it’s ok for him to approach Rebecca!","Honesty, loyalty and compassion "
Male,No,"Since Mark is my good friend and my family doesn't accept the girl, I would give my friend the job in a manner worthy of a good friend.","Pay attention to your partner and always be understanding and love him very, very much"
Female,No,"Well, for starters, that sucks. If I were John, I'd allow Mark to proceed in a relationship with Rebecca, but if she showed no interest in Mark, I'd date her no matter what others think.","Who they are as a person, as simple as that sounds. Their heart, mind, and soul will live longer than their body and looks. Focus on the things that will love you, not the things that only your eyes would love. Yes, you should be physically attracted to your partner, but you should also be generally attracted to them, too. You should love THEM, not desire them only for their looks. 

Hypothetically, say you're a writer. If you sit at your desk and find you can only write about your partner's curves, or their hair, or their pretty eyes, and other physical attributes, perhaps look deeper within and wonder if you love them for who they are. Write about how the stardust that makes them intoxicates you each time you hear their voice, talk about how their soul has captured yours in an iron fist, and merged you two to become one. Write about what makes them beautiful, not what already is.

Love them for what makes them beautiful."
Other,Yes,"F they both like each other,  then they should get together. It is on their family and friends if they do not approve.","Honesty, as well as how the dynamic would work. There should be clear boundaries as well as responsibilities."
Other,Maybe,"John should express his feelings for Rebecca, despite the possibility of losing his friend and respect of his family.","you should consider how the relationship would affect your other, non romantic relationships, and how it would change your current relationship with the person you wish to pursue."
Male,Yes,"Sometimes you have to put aside other people's feelings, prejudices, beliefs, and do what is right for one's self. If that means alienating family and friends in the pursuit of what makes yourself happy then that is something that you have make a choice on which is most important to yourself. I believe that John should proceed, but cautiously and perhaps subtly as to not completely cut off those in his life. Perhaps both groups may come around if they see he is happy. It's a chance that one must take sometimes.","Well being true to yourself is a big starter. My thoughts are that if you are happy in love and life than others can see that as good sign, every worry and problem sort of fades away. Time heals, people change their minds, and love conquers all. "
Female,Maybe,"John should be honest with himself, his friends and his family and love her no matter her religion- sexuality or race.",You should consider first and foremost if you're even well situated in life for a relationship like that. If you can't take care of yourself how will you take care of others?
Male,No,"I guess Jonh should start a relationship with Rebecca since she said she has a attraction to him and because sometimes family just try to stop you from doing things cuz they only matter with appearance and status and in these days i dont think its that hard to get a house, a decent job and money.","If that person was going to love you, i would recommend to date for some months to see how it goes and then you decide "
Male,Yes,"If he truly loves her for a good reason, then his friends and family should expect them and Mark should instead suport John rather be envious.","you should share similar ideas, or interests, I myself loved a girl who had so many artistic capabilities and amazing stories, you should find someone who is similar, but beauty is a nice + as well. then again, im younger than 20 so heh..."
Female,Maybe,My thoughts are that he should explain to his family that she is no different from them and that she is kind nothing is bigger than there personality.,That they might be putting up a act and you should be aware of this. 
Other,Maybe,I feel like families shouldn't be disapproving of love because of gender or race  and its worryingly common. And friends shouldn't be jealous of other friends relationships,"i dunno, ive never been in a romantic relationship lmao"
Prefer not to say,Maybe,I would tell her how I would feel and tell her my problem with us being together to see if she would understand ,You should be pursuing about a person’s personality and how you feel around them and if you are comfortable with them. Romance isn’t all about looking beautiful 
Male,Maybe,One should never judge people by the color of their skin.,Personality and appearance
Male,Yes,If it is just based on looks it is really a relationship?,"Similar interest to enjoy together, but being open to sharing/being shown other interest they may have. Don't go into something with the intent to crush/destroy their interest. You don't always have to enjoy the same things, sometimes even in a relationship, it should be okay to do things that aren't of the others interest. As long as it doesn't do harm to the relationship. It may seem like having your cake and eating it too, but one should not have to give up everything to just keep something that may not be a good thing alive."
Male,Maybe,"If John loves Rebecca than he should just go for it. And if his family doesn't approve of Rebecca's skin color, that's their problem, it shouldn't get in the way of how John feels. And Mark should just move on, if he is unable to win Rebecca's love, than he should suck it up and move on with his life.","There must always be honesty, loyalty, understanding, communication, and kindness. If you really love someone than prove it, respect them and their needs. Look, I'm not an expert, but all I know is that you should at least try to do whatever you can to make the other happy, but still remember you're just as an important. And deserve to be happy too, it can't be a one-sided relationship."
Prefer not to say,Maybe,"If John and Rebecca's feelings are mutual, they should start little by little. Yes, it is true that Mark also has feelings for her, over time that may change over time and he ends up falling in love with someone else. How much, to John's Family, they should leave behind their Skin Color Prejudices and focus on other more important aspects, such as their son's happiness, and get to know Rebecca beyond what they see, and look more in Personality.","Well, they should consider many things. For example: The Personality of Each One, The Things You Like, Your Future Plans or Your Dreams. In addition to seeing if they can be there and support each other. Have Respect, Dignity, Love, Fidelity and Get families and friends of friends to know each other and get along. beyond the differences that may exist."
Female,Yes,"What could be done is for the three of them to talk, confessing everything, and agreeing if Rebecca has the same feelings for either of them, and if it is with John that he will talk to his family about their relationship.","the fact that the person is clear about what they want, so that in this way they can have good communication to avoid toxicities in the relationship."
Male,Maybe,I think he should because that's how he feels and if he and her are over 18 then leave so he can love her,Someone that has similar interests to you cares about you and consider your feeling and you their's 
Male,Maybe,Ignore what his family thinks and date Rebecca ,"Similar up bringing, have more of a connection "
Male,Maybe,"I feel like John should proceed with that relationship, not only does the girl have feeling for him but it’s not like he’s going out behind marks back, Mark clearly hasn’t made a move and so John can take that opportunity. Also it doesn’t matter the skin color of another person, all that matters is if that person treats you with kindness, love and respect.",Someone who treats you the same way you treat them (I’m talking about in a positive way)
Male,Maybe,John should pursue the relationship with Rebecca.,Good open communication and willingness on both parties to give more than you take.
Prefer not to say,Maybe,"maybe meet her parents first, and then go from there",someone who cares for them as much as they care about the person that they're in love with
Male,Maybe,"I don't think it matters what the family thinks in romantic relationships, although a supportive family is helpful.","Mutual attraction, mutual trust, mutual understanding."
Male,Maybe,"John and Mark should talk it out about since they are both interested in Rebecca to not damage their friendship before John talks to Rebecca. John and Rebecca's relationship should take priority over his family's disapproval, however this may not be possible depending on unknown information. If John still need's his family support to live, either because he is a minor living in their household or cannot financially live on his own, his relationship with Rebecca might need to be secret until he has safe means to live away from his disapproving family.",Romance is complicated. Long distance relationships can be difficult even with internet bridging the gap. How family and friends feel about the relationship. Even things like past relationship history can be a factor in how someone decides to pursue a new romantic relationship.
Male,Maybe,John should tell his parents to suck it. He should tell them that their opinions don't matter. ,"Act casual. Be kind and courteous to the love interest. Be discrete that you like her, but also hint it in a manner they can sort of grasp. Then, when a few weeks or so have passed, it's advised to ask her out, if good progress is made, and she likes you, or is interested in you."
Prefer not to say,Yes,He should tell her about his feelings. what makes him happy is what is most important!,"what makes both parties happy. happy spouse, happy house!"
Prefer not to say,Maybe,"I feel like John should act on his feelings for Rebecca, and that her skin color shouldn't matter. After all, she is just another person. Though this may upset his family, it shouldn't be their concern or even their business to worry about the kinds of people John dates; its John's choice to date the people he chooses. ","People should consider their emotional state, if they're ready or not. If they are, then they should now both sides of the tide when testing the waters of a new relationship."
Male,Yes,Well if he really likes her then yea I'd say he go for it. He could talk it out with his friends about it and try to get a mutual relationship with them. And he should also talk about how his parents would need to accept her since in our modern age skin color doesn't matter as much. That's all I could say.,"Well, if they want to keep the relationship healthy they should tell their mate if there's anything wrong that they would fix. And try being self conscious about what you do with your mate I guess."
Female,Maybe,"I don't give a fuck actually. All this people need is just a conversation and aduquete way to express their feelings and wishes

If they cannot talk, they are stupid af","Alcoholic, narcotic or other form of addiction, mental, emotional and financial instability, failure to pass a trust test - any of this - immediately sweep the person aside. 

Everything else is solvable "
Male,No,"John and Rebecca should be together and be honest about how they feel towards each other. His friends are expected to be supportive and understanding, even if one of them has some sort of attraction to her. If they do not, they were not his friends in first place. The family should understand that John is an adult (supposedly) and he has any right to a relationship as anybody else, as well as have his own family if all goes well. ","Companionship, understanding, intimacy, openness, sharing lifes goals"
Female,Yes,"Love is blind. Actually, it's better to accept whoever the person was from everything he/she had. Somehow, it's struggling if his family couldn't approve her skin color. The only thing I could say is, John could follow his feelings because his decision was on him. Not on his family. That was his only freedom and joy to love Rebecca for the rest of his life. ","Better learn to accept everything from each other and give the best time you ever had for your partner. But yeah, it's sad for me once I learned this lesson when I'm with my 1st ex before. We could accept each other. Unfortunately, I never gave him time to talk, so he was been intrigue with other person."
Male,Maybe,"Most people may have different definitions of the term ""beautiful"". Rebecca may look nice in terms of appearance or physique. Or Rebecca may have such a perfect personality with strong passion, high minded attitude and a great sense of humour. John should think about the impact that can affect him when having Rebecca in his life. If John feels like he is willing to take such a commitment, therefore, John should proceed in telling her about his feeling regardless of the ups and downs that will occur. Such an opportunity may only happen once in a lifetime. ","I believe most people should be mindful when pursuing a romantic relationship. Having a partner in your life is like handling your own with twice the effort. For someone who can handle their life independently, it can be hard to find reasons to even pursue a relationship. ""Why should I spend more time in a relationship where I can just happily live on my own?"". One reason to have a romantic partner is to have a boost in your lifestyle. When starting a business, you may have some sense of encouragement from your partner. When dealing with losses or an unhealthy climate, you can have someone to take care of you. When it comes to starting a family or going on vacation, it all depends on the time and effort that you are willing to share for better contentment. With most people today ""blinded by love"", they will find it difficult to sustain a romantic relationship. Overall, before pursuing this, advice that I'll give would be ""Love yourself first before loving others""."
Prefer not to say,No,i say that john tell Rebecca how he feels and his predicament to shed some light to that john and Rebecca can figure it out ,"they should consider how the other person feels, what their reaction would be, and how happy both people would be."
Female,No,"I think it's a tough situation for John. It all depends on what he values. If it's his friendship with Mark or his family's validation, then he won't pursue Rebecca. But if he values Rebecca as a person, or as a love interest more, then he'll pursue her. Ultimately, he should choose whatever makes him the most happy, or aligns with his morals more.","To be honest, and I know this isn't completely realistic, all that matter is if you love the other person, and they love you back. People can move mountains for someone they love, romantic or not. As long as both parties have a similar passion and dedication for the other, there's nothing they need to worry about. (Besides death lol)"
Other,Yes,"I think John's family should go fuck themselves for being racist. John is a king, he should date whoever he wants. Gold star for not being racist John. Also, dude make Mark jealous, you take Rebecca from him. I want battle.","Make sure that the person you're interested in is nice to you. nothing else really matters. If they're a dick to you, don't go after them."
Prefer not to say,No,If they love each other  then leave them be her skin doesn’t matter,How much communication and care a relationship needs 
Other,No,"It would be best for John to have a conversation with Mark, expressing how he also has feelings for Rebecca and she has expressed interest in him as well. This way, John could ensure that there would be no hard feelings. If Mark were to get upset over John and Rebecca finding happiness, Mark may not be the best friend. As for John's family, while it is difficult, I would say he should choose Rebecca over the ones who are so narrow-minded as to judge someone based on their skin color.","They should consider what they have in common, especially their beliefs are on topics such as religion, politics, science, etc. As well as this, they should consider their differences and decide whether they are irreconcilable or something that they can get over."
Male,Maybe,John should follow his heart and not worry too much on what others believe or think.,"The most important thing I consider is who the person is on the inside. The outside fades away, but the inside can build you up, and make love a great and wonderful thing."
Male,No,"It's a pretty common dilemna, i think John if he can  shouldn't risk his friendship by going out with rebecca, if heis not only attracted by her but deeply oin love with her then he should. Sex is not as valuable  as friendship in many cases. Also John's family seems pretty dumb and he shuld not care about those people think even if they're family. XD",love is not a matter of the mind imo so i can't think of anything special except mutual respect.
Male,Yes,Don't let others get in the way of your life ,Making sure the person you love is happy with the relationship 
Male,Yes,Run away to Mexico and start a new life ,Date with intent not just cause or for sex and be as open as possible 
Male,Maybe,"1. John's parents have no rights to forbid him loving Rebecca.
2. If Rebecca really likes John then they should be together. Mark can be envious, it's his right as human to feel emotion but shouldn't do anything to break their relationship, because it's Rebecca's choice who she likes","Hard question, cannot answer. Personally I was (am) in only one relationship and did never consider anything. It was always doing what heart told me to do, nothing more, nothing less"
Female,Maybe,"Date, who gives a fuck if the parents or friends don’t like her as long and they’re happy and safe and it’s a good healthy relationship who gives a fuck if they’re different skin colors ",Depends on people bro 
Male,Maybe,Tell the Rebecca to Love you.,understanding
Other,Yes,"Life is not a job, it is a gift or perhaps a curse as everything is this world works normaly, no matter how anomally it is in many vision. Whatever choice of decision that puts you in any kind of action, it is normal.

You're not asked to be born in this world, your existence is forced by one singular or many force(s), therefore you're free to do anything you want as the force that forced you to exist does to you, but expect resistance, as many heroes and villains does before you.","Considering something that doesn't exist while you're in present isn't realistic, thoughts could prevent you from start acting."
Other,No,"If your family is racist, you should cut them out of your life. If both parties [John and Rebecca] are interested in each other, then they should pursue a relationship regardless of if others approve or not. Although, if one is only pursuing the other for the attractiveness/making someone else jealous, then the relationship should not be pursued because that is unfair to the 'arm candy'.","The biggest thing is if both parties are actually wanting to be in the relationship--you should never force or otherwise coerce someone into a situation they do not want to be in, which includes any type of relationship. Additionally, you have to be willing to commit to the person and commit to having open communication, otherwise the relationship is almost certainly doomed to fail. "
Female,No,"John and Rebecca are adults free to live by their chosen values. If John is committed to Rebecca, then her happiness and well-being must be prioritized over the envy or prejudices of his friends and family. If he cannot prioritize her, he should not pursue a relationship. The fact that he is unsure is a red flag for Rebecca. ","Do you value the other person? Love is not the euphoria you feel when you are with them. That fades away. Love is not desire. Love is value. Do you value them? Do you feel valued? Can you communicate about emotionally difficult issues? Are you willing to try? Is the other person's happiness and well-being important to you. Do you feel the same from them? If two people don't have this drive, then the day will come when they no longer try to problem solve the challenges that come. "
Female,Maybe,I believe that if John loves Rebecca he should tell her how he feels regardless of his family's disapproval. I also think that he should educate his family about rases that are not their own. ,I think people should consider there potential lover's personally and actions. 
Male,Yes,"I think they should be guided by their feelings, not taking into account the opinion of third parties, the two of them being the only constant.","
'complementation', obviously there would be other variants but I think it should be taken into account when looking for a relationship."
Male,Yes,"1. I don't think there is anything wrong with John engagin in a relationship with Rebecca and all his friends being envious about it. At some point, they will get over it. As Rebecca already expressed feelings or indicated that she is attracted, I don't see how John's friends would still pursue Rebecca. They can maybe even find someone better than her as there are a lot of people in the world.
2. Family not approving of Rebecca is probably not of skin color but of race. As the saying goes, ""same feathers, flock together"" to which I understand the sentiment. The culture differs, and the family may be seeing it from a conservative viewpoint. ","1. Agreement with parents - This is not that popular, but I do believe that parents have a say to your relationship (not completely as it really depends on the situation | ex: your parents are in prison or something - very unlikely for both of them to be).
2. Mutual interest - Purusing someone who doesn't like you at all will go nowhere. I'm not saying that the person should give up. I'm saying that they have to take it step by step and engage the person slowly as they will become interested in you at some point."
Male,Maybe,Tell her how he feels,"Finding out what the other person wants from the relationship, such as marriage, kids, etc. See if the values between the two are compatible and if they're looking for the same lifestyle."
Male,Maybe,this one is hard... John should be nice to his friend and tell his parents to stop being racist.,Being a decent person. 
Male,Yes,My thoughts on this situation are being insecure about one's feeling while not showing your attraction towards them.,"Try to be natural, be more yourself and respond to them."
Male,No,"John should pursue a relationship with Rebecca regardless of Mark's feelings for her or the disapproval of John's family. You can be respectful of other people's feelings without letting them stop you from doing what you believe is the right thing to do. This might be John's only chance in life for true happiness in an intimate relationship and he cannot let others dictate his course of action. The biggest regrets in life, I believe, do not come from failure. They come from not even trying.","Personally, I don't believe there should be many outside things to consider. Individuals need to live their lives as they see fit, not by how someone else sees fit. Family, friends, society, culture pressure people to do things and live their lives a certain way and what is and is not acceptable. Please yourself and follow what you want to follow. It is your life. It is short and there is only one chance at it"
Other,Maybe,John should go after Rebecca-- that his family is racist or that his friend is interested too is not important. All that matters in a relationship are the people directly involved.,"Be kind and understanding, set healthy boundaries, communicate when you are upset."
Male,Maybe,"I'm a simple man, if my religion allow it so I can do it. Thats why we need religion to surpass our boundaries. If Okay situation, I will tell John that I want to be close with Rebecca and compete fairly. As other aspect it will be statdeb by my religion.","Destiny of soulmate, I believe there is (at least) someone (or more for my religion) for each of us. When you know it, you should pursue it. And although it took hard path, I already find my only one soulmate. Hope it help. Out of the box."
Male,Yes,In my opionion John just have to follow his heart and ask Rebecca out. Love shouöd not be corrected by other people.,"People should give a love back in a romantic relationship, but also respecting themself and to be used or abused by a partner."
Female,Maybe,"If that's how he feels then he needs to speak up and tell her and if his parents don't approve then he need to follow his heart if he thinks that they will be together for a long time then it's good to look on the future and if his friend wants her then she gets to pick who she wants to be with and like Martin Luther King Jr said ""You shouldn't be judged by the color of your skin but of your actions.""",I'm sorry but I don't understand the question and I don't too much about love I'm only 13 about to turn 14 in 2 weeks
Other,Yes,"I think maybe John shouldn't care what his family thinks of her, regardless of Rebecca's skin color, he finds her beautiful just the way she is. His happiness should come first.",I feel as if people should consider their own mental health before proceeding with romantic relationships. I've learnt from experience that it's hard to love someone else when you're not happy with yourself.
Female,No,"If you are willing to give up friendship, I think go for it. I would not consider Johns family’s say, since their logic is irrational. 
Also, if you have friends that will envy your love life instead of congratulating, and treats you sorely based on it, I think they are not worth being friends with.",Do their values meet yours? Are they responsible? Can you see a stable future with them? Are they kind? Are the intelligent? 
Prefer not to say,No,"Both John and Mark have the right to feel attracted to Rebecca, and both have the right to begin a relationship with her. John should not feel obligated to do exactly what his parents expect of him (relationship wise) and knowing that Rebecca feels the same way, John should ask her out. Mark, on the other hand, should probably not begin a relationship with Rebecca, because he knows it will upset his friends.","When a person is looking for a partner, they should aim to find someone who makes them feel happy. Personally, I've found that while it is best to share the same interests, sometimes you'll work well with someone who has possibly never even heard of your interests."
Prefer not to say,Maybe,"If you love your family, don't do something that will disappoint them, talk to them, persuade them till they agree to your choice to be in relationship.","Appearance, attitude, principle, environment o.o"
Other,No,"It is a very difficult situation for John and I feel as though no option would be 100% satisfiable. If he were to confess his feelings towards Rebecca, there would be a high possibility he would lose his connection to his family and his friend. However, if Mark was to abandon his friendship with John, it can be argued that Mark was never a true friend to begin with. It can also be argued that Johns family is also equally as problematic, as skin color should not be a concern for them as long as their child is happy. In the end, John should pick what choice makes him happy, and as his family is already morally questionable, the ultimate decision would be keeping his friend or find love. 
I personally would suggest that everything considered, John should confess to Rebecca, as there are more upsides to finding love than keeping bad company.",Communication is key. Listen to other people. Don't react when you're in extreme emotions.
Male,Yes,"Not a problem, if he loves her carry on",importantly is there feelings....
Female,Maybe,Well... it's hard to choose between the object of love and friendship. But if Jhon and Rebecca realy love each other they should be together  despite what family or society thought. And there is another way: Rebecca can finde another person to build relationships. Not Jhon or Mark,"mutual respect, trust, support, understanding,  common interests,  similar views on life"
Female,No,"I think John should try. His parents seem to be quite conservative and they should see more examples of their beliefs being wrong (Idk what other stereotypes are sitting in their heads, but if they see that Rebecca is a good girl and John really loves her, they may reconsider their opinion). John shouldn't ruin his life because of the opinions of other people, including his friend's. Mark may be happy for John or be a rival, but he must back down if Rebecca prefers John.","Upbringing and worldview, because it greatly affects a person's behavior and motives. You will think that your partner doesn't love you if they don't meet you on their knees, but for their culture this may be the norm. If you and your partner are not ready to accept such differences, you'd better find someone else. You also have to consider each other's psychological health if you don't want to become someone who's being manipulated or break an innocent person."
Prefer not to say,Maybe,John shouldn't be pressured by peers against dating Rebecca. ,Opposites don't really attract (unless you're a magnet). 
Male,No,"That depends on how old john is. If he risks his relationship with his family without being able to sustain a life by himself it would make life and thus the relationship really hard. If she is ""the one"" (which i personally think does not exist) go for it. If john has his own household and is not dependent on is family i think that the choice is a no-brainer. Considering the feelings of his friend for his to be girlfriend, it should be talked through with all 3. Maybe they can even form a relationship as a pair of 3. Also if he chooses to go for it, he should NEVER held it against her that he ""left his family"" for her. Yeah that should cover most of the options xP","That after the early stage it becomes ""work"" to keep the relationship functioning. If you can't do it don't even bother and discuss this openly. In my opinion you should be able to discuss everything with the person you have romantic feelings for even though the topic might be awkward to tackle. "
Male,Maybe,"If John has feelings for her and his family lives him, they will come around. ",Compatiblity. Emotional connection. 
Male,Yes,"Life rarely gives you a second chance so I hope John succeeds in his confession with Rebecca. On the other hand, I hope John's expression of sincerity towards Rebecca would be enough to deter his friends' jealousy for romance and envy for love. May his conviction never falter for it is the ultimate form of love.","Overthinking about it rarely provides meaningful results. Many people say that you should just be yourself in pursuit of romance, a topic that has been a subject of debate depending on who you ask. In my humble opinion, I do believe in the saying that nothing is constant in this world except change so if you're to remain your true self, you must endlessly pursuit change (positive ones, of course) till you can no longer do so. Everything else becomes easy when you treat yourself a little bit better than usual. But then again, this is simply the opinion of one man so feel free to think of new ways to succeed in romance."
Male,No,"I can't understand why Mark is in this story. I think Mark will stop being John's friend if John and Rebecca are dating. Well, John is probably no longer a little boy to ask permission from his parents. Now we live in a time when skin color, nationality or race are completely irrelevant. Anyone has every right to meet with whomever they want, if the feelings are mutual.","Any relationship can end at any time if one or both parties treat this relationship irresponsibly. Most relationships, unfortunately, break up when faced with domestic problems. Relationships are a lot of work for both partners. So that in old age one can take care of the other."
Female,No,"Confessing feelings are only a confess, the rest, future will take care of it. It's nice to let life guide us sometimes instead of trying to get control on everything. People will only show their true faces, nothing more, nothing less. Only then he'll be able to make true choices too.","Hapiness, theirs, and the one of people they love. Doing what's right, being kind, empathetic, without forgeting themselves too. Not correcting the behaviour of others, one's freedom stop when the freedom of others begin. If you're unhappy with the way of being of someone, you have the choice to walk off this path or stay."
Male,Maybe,"If they both are attracted to each other and there's no third party, they should go for it. 
","Physical and Mental Attraction, Compatibility and goals "
Male,No,He should do so and tell her what he feels ,Love each other
Male,Maybe,"John must understand what is of great value to him: his friend or girlfriend.
A girl should not be a stumbling block between friends.",Responsibility 
Male,Maybe,I would listen to the voice of my heart,"trust, harmony, understanding, spark/attraction, common outlook on life and future"
Male,Maybe,"If John is able to work out the situation with Mark by explaining that Rebecca is interested in him then the only real obstacle would be his family, if Mark does have strong feelings for her then I’m sure he wouldn’t mind his friend taking Rebecca as it would make her happy and that should be all that counts.","What are their hobbies, who else likes to purse a relationship with that someone, is that someone interested in you."
Male,Maybe,"He should tell how he feels no matter what because he loves her, your friends are less important than your love.","You should care about who you are into, never lie to them no matter really what, and if you do try to be as honest as possible with whoever you like or love, they should be very important to you."
Male,Yes,bros before hoes,"their background, their personality, what they’ve done, and what they want with you, and if they want to work or not"
Male,Maybe,"I honestly feel sick to my stomach with this one. If John should love who he wants, it shouldn't matter what the skin color is. His friends, if they really were his friends, should just accept and move on. As for his parents, John should argue with them about their seemingly racist views.","They should understand any mental conditions like ADD or ADHD, and accept it. It's something that they can't change, and if you do try to change it, you're a terrible partner. 

Also, connect on an emotional level. For men, it's difficult because society doesn't care if men have these problems or not. They tell them to suck it up, brush it off, walk it off, but that's doing more harm because there's a difference between emotional trauma and physical trauma. This is why men are far more likely to commit suicide. We don't a lot, if any, emotional outlets.

Finally, communicate. It's simple, but most people these days are glued to their phones, computers, or videogame systems. Admittedly I am too, but I keep in touch and talk with my significant other. "
Female,Yes,"I feel as though John should continue in a relationship with Rebecca. Considering the color of someone's skin when deciding on pursuing a relationship with them or not is racist and wrong. I am very very white and am currently with a Hispanic (Cuban) man, and we're in a happy relationship together. Even if John's family doesn't like her skin color they'll get over it eventually, but if, say, she was mean and cold, then I'd get it.","I feel like mainly you should look for personality, and after personality comes physical attraction."
Male,Maybe,"My thoughts are that John will be put in a dilemma whether if he pursues what he's thinking of her or politely give up. Because knowing his family, he should put himself and his family first over a girl he has a crush on because I feel like John's taking this relationship with Rebecca way too fast when he doesn't even know the girl all too well. Rebecca could be using him for her own selfish agendas and if I were John, I would politely decline Rebecca's offer knowing that I should focus more on myself before thinking of things like relationships.","They should prioritize on how well they know that person they have a crush on. It's important to establish trust first and strengthen bonds to make sure that the relationship isn't one sided and toxic. Also, be aware from gold diggers or those that just takes advantage of you for their own benefits. It's important that a person must first pursue his goals first, or at least maintain a good friendly relationship with the person they're romantically attracted to. It will take a lot of time but as long as you're able to fully know that person. That could be a sign that this might be the right time for you to pursue a relationship with him or her."
Male,No,"Although the conflicts presented here would certainly feel tense and would take much courage to face, I feel that the answer is very simple.
 If John feels that his love is worth the damage it could cause his family and friends, then he should of course be with Rebecca.
 There might be some level of self-sacrifice necessary for good love, but John's family and friends should not be owed large portions of his right to determine life and happiness. 
 Mark should be able to move on, even if it might take him some time away from Rebecca to do so.
  In matters of racial biases, it's common for racist beliefs to not be as hard-set as one may think; maybe merely having gone unchallenged. I believe and I would hope that after meeting Rebecca and spending time with her, John's family members might go through a period where those beliefs were tested. Some of them may be able to adapt their worldview, and accept Rebecca and John's love with open arms.","I don't think I can come up with a supremely unique answer in this regard. I think most emotionally mature adults understand what is both desirable traits to seek in a partner, as well as how a functional relationship is maintained afterward.
 Being attracted to someone physically is probably at least a little important, and sexual incompatibility is a very common cause for relationships to fall apart.
 One should seek to discover the virtues present in someone. Depending on how casual the relationship you're seeking is, this will be less important. 
Usually, the thing that makes you first take notice of someone is very mundane or nebulous. They're pretty, or you just wanted to say hello.
 But it's only after having examined their character and observed how they engage with life, that the feeling of love emerges."
Prefer not to say,No,"I believe that the mutual feelings between those two people are important, and both must evaluate how they value that compared to other relationships.","I identify as Aro/Ace, and I am not knowledgeable or educated on the pursuit of romantic relationships."
Female,Maybe,"I think he should tell her how he feels, he deserves a chance at that happiness in being with her. It has risks, and there will most-likely be some pain and damage control needed afterwards. It would be nice of him to try to spare everyone who could be hurt by his decision, but he still has to think about himself too.","If the person makes them happy, and if they have fun and see themselves still being with this person down the road. "
Female,Maybe,I don't know but his family shouldn't be in their relationship. ,"Trust, stable life, joy, someone to be there and you do the same thing."
Male,No,"(Firstable, I am non-native english, so my english is not perfect.)
I think that everyone should respect the relation between John and Rebecca. If they are John's friends, they have to respect him. For Mark, he should understand that John and Rebecca are in love, he should be happy for both of them. I know feelings are hard, but we have to make the right thing.
And for the family... You can't judge someone for their skin, nor sexuality nor tastes... The only important is our being, our attitude. My opinion is that this is so preposterous, but not for John nor Rebecca, but the others. And of course they all should respect what Rebecca wants, if they like her. And about she's handsome and everyone loves her... Is just a shape, no one is handsome nor ugly by the face nor body, but by the brain and heart. Is not nice to ""love"" someone just for its aspect. That's not love, love is to take care of that person, love is empathy. :)
A bit long, but I think I'm done with this one. :D","""With someone else""? I don't know if this means to cheat on someone, which is bad, but I'll take the answer as no cheating.
Firstable, if you want to have a relation with someone, you have to be FRIENDS first. The best relations are those which starts with Friendship, if you meet someone and then you have a relation, you don't know that person, you don't know everything about that person, you can get hurt, VERY hurt. And that happens a lot in this world... ""Seek boy/girlfriends"". That sentence should not exist. You can love a friend, a lot, and when you both take care of each other, respect tastes... that love can increase even more, and if both want to, a relation starts. That's the real love, is very hard to cheat on someone in that way. Y'know?
So that's all. :D

PD: About ""Shakespeare famously said, that ""all is fair in love and war."" Do you agree with this?"" I said ""No"", because wars are not fair, I don't care if there are no rules in war, a lot of innocent people die by the fault of wars... Nothing is fair in war in my sight. And about the love... Not everything can be fair, depending on what you mean, but only if it's true love, then you act well and fair. :)"
Male,No,"Well, I think he should try to explain that God created humankind regardless of skin color, and that HE - God - wouldn't love her any less because of her appearance.","Three Things: 
1. Is she religious or does she have a good temperament?
2. Does she like some of the things you like?
And 3. Is she old enough to marry...or am I too old or young...or vice versa?"

Prefer not to say,Maybe,"bad thing, i don't like the way the world works now. People are currently: fighting because we are stupid, and always have a very stupid reason to mistreat others and make wars.","Well, respect and trust. Personally for me it takes a person to have a deep emotional connection with them."
Female,Yes,se eu fosse o John eu  falaria assim amor tenho uma coisa pra te dizer o que temos pra hoje é saudade kkkkk brincadeira se eu fosse o John eu falaria pra Rebeca assim Rebeca você é o sol que me ilumina os dias passam e eu não paro de pensar como seria os nossos momentos juntos cada dia sem vc é uma faca no meu coração sem você  sou um mendigo que fica na rua pedindo carinho como se eu fosse uma rosa que as pétalas estão caindo você é meu sonho de verão a luz do meu coração sou capaz de fazer qualquer coisa por você  eu emfretaria meus pais por vc  então rebeca ve a carta e se apaixona pela pessoa que escreveu a carta mas jonh fala que mark escreveu a carta a rebeca fica com o mark mas  mark descobre que jonh que escreveu a carta e mark vai até a casa de jonh e ele entra no quarto de jonh e jonh está dormindo até que mark o acorda e ele diz jonh vem levanta você não tem muito tempo a rebeca está indo embora mas john não entende porque mark está falando na rebeca e john fala mark  me deixa dormir você e a rebeca são perfeitos juntos e meus pais nunca aceitariam ela  então mark pega um taco e bate em jonh e mark fala acordaaaa cara se liga ela ama voce e não eu e john fala que isso mano quer me  matar seu maluco  e mark diz sim agora se veste rapido  e jonh se veste e tenta chegar ao lado de rebeca mas ele chega  tarde demais e o voou de rebeca já saiu faz tempo mas Rebeca não foi e jonh está sentado deprimido e triste mas rebeca grita o nome de jonh e jonh a ve com um vestido amarelo e cheio de bolinhas brancas com um chapel. branco e uma rosa vermelha eles correm e se beijam e mark fica feliz pelo seu amigo e mark acaba conhecendo  uma japonesa chamada angel ele no mercado ele fica tão fascinado com angel e pergunta se ela não gostaria de tomar um café angel aceita e  Angel fala todos os idiomas ela conta que nasceu no brasil em um orfanato e que seus pais do japão a mandaram pra lá durante a guerra ela fala como ela não tinha muitos amigos e a chamavam de ete por ter olhos puxadinhos  ela fala que só os livros eram sua companhia   ela sabe de tudo com os livros ela teve muito conhecimento e mark acaba se casando com angel e rebeca e jonh tem dois filhos e fim,mais importante é ser você mesmo desde o início. No final sua verdadeira personalidade sairá e essa pessoa pode se sentir enganada. Interesse-se pelas coisas que essa pessoa gosta e pergunte sobre elas.

Male,No,"If John is attracted to her and knows that this realationship is what he really desires and the feelings are mutual - I think he should go ahead. In every circumstance it is most important to listen to one self. He should express himself in any shape or form he wants to. Including this relationship. Outside opinions that might hinder John to be himself should be ignored. If that is what he feels attracted to, called to or exited to pursue - then he should do it.","That both parties can completely be themselves. I also think that beeing open and able to listen and talk about one's feelings is also an important part. 
Communication and acceptance to put it short. "
Male,Yes,"I thiknk that, it shouldn't matter who thinks of your relationship due to a person's skin color and that love is indeed love, especially if the other person feels that way for the other. If they are willing to love each other, no matter whatpeople say or thibki of it, I'd say he should go for it and make his heart more loved.","People should always consider the plans and the timing n eing ready for a relationship meaning to have Trust, Royalty, Care, Kindness and that they are willing to let this person be there for them, have their back, protect them and love them to their hearts content an value their life to them. And if a relationship can work it out, no matter what happens or what they may have to get through every day, then you got yourself a beautiful relationship that can work with the others love."
Male,No,"I think John and Rebecca should do what they feel is right for them. If they are sure of what each feel for the other, friends and family shouldn't be judgemental. ",If both are into it. Is it completely consensual.
Male,Yes,"I don't think anything in particular. It doesn't move me that much... Everyone does what they want with their lives! If John wishes to declare himself, why not do so? If mark wishes to declare himself, why not do so? In the end, everyone is free to do what they want! Life and its paths will take their course according to the decisions made.","I don't know because I've never had a romantic relationship. In a detached way, I would say that you just have to follow your heart. What more can be said ? In fact, I don't care a bit! I feel so far from all these considerations that it has little impact on me. For me, life is a series of choices that depend on a lot of things and each of them leads us in a direction. There are so many possibilities that there is no ""pre-established"" pattern, just feelings in the moment!"
Male,No,"don't do it, bitches be crazy",if they are already in a relationship or not 
Prefer not to say,Maybe,John and Mark both like the girl and I think that John should talk to Mark about the following conundrum. He should talk to his family and try to state out why he likes the girl and try to convince them that his love for Rebecca is serious. If not working out just try again but in different words and manner.,"Who is your lover? Try to get to know them and try getting them to talk about family, never force them if not wanted. What do they like? Personally, I like to know what my girlfriend or boyfriend thinks, likes or what their hobbies are. "
Male,Yes,"If need be, burn bridges with everyone else in favor of Rebecca. She seems like a nice girl and jealousy and racism will only weigh John down. People are replaceable.",The feelings of yourself and the other person. That's it.
Male,Yes,"From my initial perspective, John loves Rebecca for who she was, unlike his parents. As well, there is a possible chance of infidelity if Mark still persists in being with Rebecca even if she is already with John.","What I want to consider when pursing romantic relationships with someone else are the content of characters, looka, emotional maturity and that they are at least the age of consent (if one is above the age of consent)"
Male,Yes,My thoughts are that John and mark are both interested in Rebecca the problem is Rebecca skin is different so her parents do not approve and that she is attracted to John and would like to be in a relationship ,You got to be nice  spend time together talk a lot respect be honest loyalty 
Female,No,"He definetely should be with Rebecca, since both of them have feelings for each other. At the same time John should be straightforward in telling Mark about that. In this situation, where two men fell for same woman, only she herself  can resolve everything. And because Rebecca's choice was John, there shouldn't be any grievances between two friends in the end. Speaking of parents's approval, if John  has heart to be with Rebecca then he should stand his ground, despite what his parents say.","First thing to be considered is feelings go both ways or one-sided?
Probably, second case is hopeless and it's simply useless to pursue any further.
If you are lucky and feeling is mutual, then should considered how much two people are comfortable with each other, how similar their value systems and life priorities."
Female,Maybe,"Well, if the family for John is an important enough link in his life, and he depends on it quite strongly, then it’s probably worth letting Rebecca go, because if John tells Rebecca about his feelings and starts dating her, then he may lose much more than gain. But if he is not so dependent on the opinion of the family, then he should talk to both his parents and Mark so that tragic circumstances do not develop. With the family, most likely, the problem will be solved quite simply, but with Mark you will have to negotiate. Now, if Rebecca were polyamorous ... And if Mark and John would not mind having one girlfriend for two, perhaps then they could arrange a triple relationship, the so-called ""love triangle"", only no one would get hurt. But this is a very rare situation.","First, you need to consider the wishes of the person with whom you want to have a romantic relationship. You never know, suddenly this person doesn’t like you, and then with your hints and tackles you will only harm him.

Secondly, you must consider and read the feelings of your partner. Talk to him on various topics, especially try to delve into the interests of a partner. For example, if he/she loves a certain literature, then you should understand it a bit so that you can keep up the conversation.

Thirdly, you need to talk with your partner directly about your desires. I believe that delaying the relationship will only harm those very relationships. We must not stand still, but move only forward! If the characters don’t converge, if nothing works out, you don’t need to hold on to each other, as if you don’t have anyone else, otherwise it will already be a toxic relationship."
Female,Yes,John should explain the situation with his parents with her if he's steeled his mind to proceed with her at all cost if she answers positively. If it comes to his friends he can only tone down how much he flaunts and avoid discussing Rebecca if it can be helped aroundMark.,I believe no one should be into relationships on less they're are looking forward to something future wise. It's not worth it to hop from ppl to ppl and very likely leave an unrepairable trail behind.
Male,Maybe,"If they have strong feelings for each other, regardless of skin color, proceed with the relationship and let no one stand in the way.","A strong romantic relationship is based on more than skin color or what a person sees. Much deeper, Beauty comes from the inside. Love is very important, trust, open communication, accept each other as they are, do not try to change the other person. Let no one ever come between each other."
Prefer not to say,Yes,"He should probably talk to Mark first, as if they are friends, they should be able to think of a compromise, if he decides to let Mark have Rebecca, then it's pretty much as si ple as that, but if they talk it out to a point where John would get to make the move on Rebecca, he should try talking to his family, but overall, it's his decision, and if his family doesn't approve and badgers him, in life, you can always cut lose the people you don't want to hang out with,  and he doesn't have to be close with his family(all be it weather that's a good or bad thing) and he doesn't need anyone's approval for his own feelings.","If both of you love eachother, you shouldn't have to have the exact same interests or opinions. If you and your partner, say, get into an argument, if you really cars about eachother, you should be able to find a compromise and forgive eachother, then forget an argument. You don't always have to like the same things, you can do things you like, and you can do things your partner does. If you can't work together or try to make both people as happy as possible while still doing the things you and/or your partner enjoy, it's a good relationship."
Male,Maybe,"I think John should let her go, it doesn’t seem like it would be healthy for them to get in a relationship.","Being careful i suppose, it’s always good to be extra careful."
Male,No,"It doesn't bother me, whether the individual is of color or not, her attitude counts more than the image she carries, I personally like it
women with brown and white skin. I will only respect the decision that she has.",I have never been able to have a relationship with a person. I am in love with a person but it is difficult for me to relate because I am not sure if he already has another or not.
Male,Maybe,"There shouldn't be any concern if John's friends, including Mark, become envious of John and Rebecca starting a relationship. Neither John nor Rebecca owe anything to John's friends. It's challenging to fully speak on the matter of race without knowing the races of John and Rebecca. Those details would inform the racial dynamic.","Relationship goals, age differences (if any), and living distances from each other, to name a few."
Other,Maybe,"There is nothing morally wrong with the situation ! He should be able to pursue a relationship regardless of his family bias, and should be able to live his life without his friends bringing him down","That what they want, and what their partner wants align. That both people can hold up their responsibilities in a relationship, so it doesn't hurt them or others "
Male,Yes,John will have to decide what relationships are most important to him,"moral character, attraction, life goals"
Male,No,john should tell her no matter the adversity that's when you know the goal is near.,"that the other person may have a different opinion or interests and that they may be completely different from us, and in extreme situations may be unpredictable. We will never know anyone 100%"
Female,No,"This is a difficult situation, but I feel there are two directions that John could go depending on the situation. Either he follows his heart and date Rebecca despite what others think and work things out with his friends (communication is important in any kind of relationship afterall). Or if the divide becomes too much between him and his friends as a result, John should consider finding someone else to date who wouldn't create this problem (intentionally or not).","It really depends on the person, since we all have different tastes. But I think there are a few things that are essential to make healthy relationship. First is to choose someone who is accepting, empathetic and understanding of you, even for you flaws or unusual quirks. It's also ideal to choose someone who brings out the best in you, and is supportive of your dreams and way of life. Of course we can't find the perfect partner, but we can choose someone who loves us despite our differences, and support each other despite those differences. If your partner can't fulfill these, then there is good chance that it wasn't meant to be. A strong relationship is built on acceptance, empathy, and communication."
Male,Maybe,"First, John should talk to his friends about his feelings, especially Mark. Afterward, if they agree to support his relationship, then John should pursue Rebecca, regardless of how his family feels, as they should be supportive of whoever he chooses to love.","Consider the needs of your partner.
What they like and dislike.
Be open with each other."
Female,Maybe,John should get with Rebecca ,Familiarity level. My current boyfriend I’ve known since we both were kids. That definitely helps. 
Female,Maybe,"Well, John must mention that he wants to have a relationship with Rebecca, John must mention what the family thinks, and what will happen to friends if they start their relationship, and mention that he doesn't care what happens, but Rebecca, and Jonh must know all that and does she know if she would dare to endure all those adversities","attentive, thoughtful, who supports me and who is tolerant"
Male,Maybe,John should go for it.,"Be cautious of the people you date, you just might never know what kind of person they are."
Male,No,"If Jon is only attracted to Rebecca, but not in love with her, then he may not care as much about her skin color and would not hesitate to pursue a relationship with her if he truly loves her.","Some of the things that people should consider when pursuing a romantic relationship with someone else include:
Compatibility: whether the two people are compatible with each other, share values, dreams, and interests.
Reliability: whether the person is proactive and invested in the relationship, trustworthy and reliable.
Mutual respect: whether the person treats you well, respects you, and is willing to listen to your opinions.
Conflict resolution skills: whether the person has the ability to resolve issues and conflicts in the relationship in a healthy and effective way.
Future awareness: whether the two people share future plans and goals, and whether they can support each other to achieve those goals.
Adaptability: Sometimes, change happens and your partner will have to adapt to it. Whether the person can adapt to unexpected changes in the relationship.
Acceptance: Whether the person accepts and loves you despite your minor flaws.
These are just some basic factors, but everyone has their own individual selection and considerations when pursuing a romantic relationship with someone they like."
Other,Yes,"He should pursue it, even if his family dissaproves. throughout life and as you age, you should be able to choose who   gets to be a part of your life",just be your best authentic self rather than puting on a persona that isn't you as a prrson
Female,No,"John shouldn't care what anyone thinks of Rebecca, and go for it if they're both consenting and aware of the situation","How they treat the opposite gender. For women, they should make sure they see how a man treats his sisters/mother, and for men, how a woman treats her brothers/father. It's a big indicator to how they'll treat you."
Prefer not to say,Yes,"I think in regards to Johns family, to judge someone based off of their skin colour isn't a very good bias to have towards anyone. I would have to know the whole situation, really. Johns current relationship with his family, how willing he is to get together with Rebecca, even if that might potentially mean severing ties with his family, or at the very least, he should talk to them about it. ","I feel like the key things that might be of interest are, First, how do you feel with this person? If you feel nervous constantly, or anxious around them, you might not want to pursue a romantic relationship with them. If you feel like you could spend the rest of your life with them, that's also good. But really, you should try and always consider the other persons feelings, and try to avoid miscommunication. "
Male,Yes,"They both get Rebecca make it a threesome, They will all love each other in the end.","Always buy a condom, and be fair to your partner"
Male,No,Well every one should go truck themselves becse Rebecca is now johns,Go easy and don't rush into a relationship 
Prefer not to say,No,"Para empezar cuando se trata amigos teniendo sentimientos por la misma persona y en este caso, saliendo con ella, yo creo que es fundamental tener en cuenta los sentimientos y el respeto mutuo entre todos los integrantes.
Si los amigos de John son realmente sus amigos seguirán con el a pesar de los celos, que esperemos sean pasajero.
Siento que John debería tener una relación con Rebbeca si realmente su amor es mutuo, a pesar de los problemas y tratar de solucionarlos juntos.","Todo depende de la persona, pero en mi caso yo buscaría alguien quien quiera una relación sana y sería, no necesariamente con la intención del matrimonio, pero si alguien quien se comprometa a pesar del tiempo."
Female,No,I think John should tell Rebecca how he feels. If he feels that there is a strong connection between him and Rebecca then the feelings of those who would have negative opinions of his decision shouldn’t matter. If the people with these negative views truly care about John they should also consider what would make John happy and race or feelings of envy will decrease ,"What do you like about them and how do they make you feel are the to big questions when initially pursuing a romantic relationship but the more important questions arise when you get into a relationship and get to know each other better like are our love languages compatible and if not are they willing to adapt to fulfill your love language and are u will to adapt to fulfil theirs, does this persons long term future align with mine for example, do they want to have children, and where do they want to live."
Male,Yes,I believe that approval from the family is not important. It is important that you love. And the opinion of others is no longer relevant.,"The very attitude, trust, love, respect"
Male,Maybe,"I think that Jonh and Mark should talk about it, make their fellings clear and express them with the other or it could end very bad for both of them, I also think that Jonh and Rebecca should start dating stead of beginning a relationship because they have to know each other better, the skin color is only a physical characteristic of a person and doesn’t affect the being of a person","They have to find a balance between themselves and the other, a healthy person take care of themselves to be able to take care of the other, it could be frustrating if it’s only the other person and never themselves "
Male,Yes,"John doesn't need anyone's permission, he can relate to Rebecca no matter what they think of him.","You must know if the love is reciprocated, if not, you just need to wish this person the best and let them go."
Female,Maybe,"It's a tough spot to be in, but sadly, social pressure can do more than your own feelings.","Care for each other, their feelings, their likes and dislikes, if they had something that can trigger something bad for the other, empathy, and support in tough times."
Prefer not to say,Yes,"Keep it going regardless if he lover her, ",Just consider the other person as much as you can
Male,No,"I think John should go for the relationship with Rebecca. Nevertheless, I am not sure the relationship between Mark and John, are they like best buddies? Is Mark a truly valuable friend to John? And does John knows about Mark's feeling towards Rebecca? In any case, if dating Rebecca means losing the best and very valuable friend, then I think John should reconsider it, as least he should talk to Mark and try something before jumping into a relationship with Rebecca. ","Other than appearance, I would say personality, common interests, and finance. "
Other,Yes,"I would tell John to tell her how he feels but if they were to start a relationship, to keep it on the down low for a bit. I’d tell John to see if his friends were good with it  after the relationship started by testing the water with Rebecca while the friends are around. Real friends would want you to be happy. As for Johns parents, I’d tell them about 6 months after the relationship started. Tell them he found a girl, but slowly add more details about her as time goes on. Then after a year of them knowing about her, id invite her over.  If they still disapprove, I’d remind them about any good qualities I told them about. If they still don’t approve, well they’ll need to learn to deal with the relationship. ","I look for things like how they treat their parents, friends, animals, and strangers. I also look for good habits, like some form of art or skating. Basically I look what’s in the book than what the cover looks like. "
Female,Maybe,"If John truly likes Rebecca and sees a nice relationship ahead, he should go for it despite the adversities presented. So long he and Rebecca truly love and support each other (and of course meet all general requirements of being able to see one another, those relating to factors such as age, potential pathways, etc.), the opinions of outsiders is not something that should matter all too much.","Relationships are about supporting your partner(s) and respecting each other no matter what. When entering a romantic relationship with someone else, it is important to recognize that you must be able to accept them as who they are, as well as what their general goals and aspirations are. But it’s also crucial to note that relationships can help with character growth, and though romantic relationships shouldn’t be made just for that, growth is always involved."
Male,Yes,John should tell Rebecca that : I'm in love with you! (and take the initiative to date each other),interpersonal relationship 、Safety 、attitude behavior style
Male,Maybe,"In this situation, John would just tell Rebecca that he's family won't allow him to love Rebecca because of her skin color.",Ask them how there day has been or what they like to do.
Male,Maybe,"I think John's family should be more open minded. Understand that skin color does not matter and learn to accept new ways. John and Rebecca have only one life where they have an opportunity to be together. The parents already have their chance and good for them, so why not let John and Rebecca be happy. The love between the two should not be overcome by closed-minded opinions that were definitely influenced in some manner of form. It would be such a sad waste of God's mysterious and brilliant talent as match maker.",They should consider their partner's own goals in life and freedom in living their own life style.
Male,Yes,"I'm no writer, but the idea of two sides against one is very intriguing for a love story involving racism and envious intent among each other. It would be fascinating to know what all sides of the story would conclude of the initial fate of John's feelings toward Rebecca with all eyes on how the other will react.

It is a fascinating concept to settle on for a story in mind.","To be honest, I'm not looking for love. So I don't have any advice for this sort of stuff."
Male,Maybe,"Is love a good enough reason to knowingly hurt others? In an ideal world, it probably is? I think if this were a real situation, more things than just ""love"" would have to be weighed against each other.

John's decision should probably be determined by how much he values certain aspects of his life. How valuable are friendship, his family's opinion, beauty in a partner, prestige among friends to him? If he finds that enough of these factors point to him pursuing the relationship and is willing to take risks, then he will probably make a move to be with Rebecca. It is true that people in his life will react negatively to this, but the course of John's life shouldn't be dictated solely by the wants of others.

One question could be: would Mark extend the same courtesy to John if he were in his place? Would he worry about how his actions affect John? If John knew the answers to these questions, should that knowledge affect his own choice? What is John's character? Is he prideful, vain, or malicious? These traits could affect his choice.

John should probably understand that he could be on the other side of a situation like this one and be prepared to accept that he may be the ""victim"" then, even as he is the antagonist/villain in this one. That might be one of the things he can learn from this.",Probably common life goals and mutual interest?
Male,No,"In my personal opinion, if John and Rebecca have mutual feelings, they should begin a relationship, no matter  the consequences in current situation. ""Restrictions"" seem unreasonable to follow here.","Safety, finances, opinion on children, responsibility, goals, borders, differences, compatibility. Too many to list, maybe."
Prefer not to say,No,"As Rebecca has already signaled her interest, it is okay for John to initiate a relationship. The situation is unfortunate for Mark, but unless she had also previously expressed interest in him this shouldn't be a factor. And what John's family think of Rebecca's skin color should be ignored, they will just have to get over it.","Compatibility, will it be possible for them to live together happily in the long term. It shouldn't be rushed into."
Female,Maybe,"Well, if John and Rebecca feel the same way, I don't think there are problems in their relationship, even if their parents don't accept their relationship, they don't have the right to interfere in their son's life even though they are his parents, just Because they don't like the color of Rebecca's skin, John's parents don't have the right to choose their son's mate, and
Even though Mark likes Rebecca, he has to learn to get over her and let her live her quiet life.","That is a mentally mature person, that is respectful and sensitive, honest, amusing, independent, empathetic and physically affectionate.

Female,Yes,He should express himself love is love ,In a good relationship people should feel safe and not like they have to lie about things
Female,No,He should talk about it with his friend and with his parents to say that he loves Rebecca and begin a relationship with her if he thinks she is the woman of his life.,"This people should consider the feelings, the way to see the world, the decisions and the freedom of the other."
Female,Maybe,"Hm... I think, situation is sound relationship.","I am sure the relationship with someone make me normal, beacuse for reason, I haven't had relationship with someone, but I accept a relationship."
Male,Maybe,"John shouldnt care about what his family thinks, if he loves someone he should just go for it. So yeah i agree, he should just tell her how he feels.","They should consider if the partner really IS the person they want to spend the time with.
They should consider how long they want the relationship to last."
Male,Maybe,John has to tell her how he feels,Tell what do you think about your feeling with your partner and other things in general
Male,No,"John should begin a relationship with Rebecca. Skin color is not relevant if you are in love with someone. Family is important but shall not rule about who do you love. John and Rebecca have to talk to Mark. As I understand, Rebecca has no strong feelings for Mark. She should tell him that. It's impossible to solve the rhe situation without hurting the feelings of anyone. So I think this is the best possible way to cope with the situation.",Don't think to much about what people might say about the relationship. It doesn't matter who doe you love. You and your partner are most important.
Male,Maybe,Mark should tell her his feelings otherwise it just build up over time. If john truly loves her then his familys aproval is not inportant.,Intress and personality.
Male,No,"John should begin a relationship with Rebecca because of their mutual feelings for each other, whilst Mark's feelings are not reciprocated. In terms of the family problems, as long as John and Rebecca's relationship is strong, there is less need for the family's consent for the relationship to take place, however this depends on how important family is to John. John's family's backward view shouldn't stop him from having a relationship with anyone. Therefore John should start a relationship with Rebecca, in almost every scenario. ","They should think of what they want, but also what they offer in return. They should reflect on how their personal goals, beliefs, etc will be effected by a potential relationship and how it will help or hinder them as well as considering the personal sacrifices that come from starting a relationship."
Male,No,"This is his choice and only his, if she is a good person, then he should not doubt.","they should be responsible and treat each other the way they would like to be treated themselves. I think, if these points are followed, there is a great chance of success in a relationship."
Female,No,"John probably has a superficial view of life in general. If we look deeply, John's purpose of life is just a self-satisfaction, enjoyment (one of which is Rebecca) and pleasing himself. John's a true hedonist, even though he wouldn't call himself like that. He think he's doing good. He doesn't really love Rebecca (although he is convinced he DOES), he loves himself, and for this he needs Rebecca, because she makes him feel happy, and her beauty, her actions are pleasant to John. Besides, John's parents and friends don't approve him dating Rebecca. Like someone said, ""if love makes a least one person in the world feel bad, then it's not love"". Not to mention subordinating the will of parents, as is customary in conservative (read: the most sensible and truly minor) communities.
I consider this whole situation as idle and not worth all this attention, because it cannot be explained to a person without a proper understanding of who he is and what's the purpose of his life. If John is convinced that nothing is going to happen after his death, or maybe he will ""reincarnate"" and won't remember any of his ""previous life"", then what's all the fuss about? Why bother loving someone if they (or you) will die? Or why bother about other people's feelings? This modern atheistic world's philosophy is absurd, this is why you won't find the right solution of this situation without understanding how this world TRULY works.

""Kirillov, if... if you could get rid of your dreadful fancies and give up your atheistic ravings... oh, what a man you'd be, Kirillov!""","""love is not about two people looking at each other, it's about two people looking in the same direction""
therefore, you and your beloved one should have the same worldview (if you don't want to break up in the end)"
Other,Maybe,"John should just tell Rebecca his feelings if he wants to start a relationship, and other people shouldn't stop him if he wants to.","Make sure it is a healthy relationship and both you and your partner are aware of each other's boundraries. And as long as you aren't hurting you or anyone else, you do you."
Male,Maybe,"Well that is difficult to respond,
I think john should still confess
His family would have to accept his feeling regarding her color
And his friend, as his friend should still consider being friends with john if he is a good friend.
It wont be smooth sailing, but it will get better as time moves on.","I don't know since i've never been in one yet but i know that you need to be in a relationship where you are both comfortable, a relationship where is clean and non toxic.
Not saying perfection, im saying that the partner you wish to be with doesnt has to be a lair
A realationship where you both love eachother and flame may never die."
Male,No,"Talk to anybody about your concerns, nothing helps more as truly open conversation where everybody can tell how she/he feels and what the situation means to one. But in the end, always listen to what your gut feel is telling you - do not decide things about love and relationships rational with your brain, we kinda lost what we are here for - spread love and be kind with everybody! Even mark will understand at some day that he doesn't need to be angry with John when it is truly Rebecca's decision to whom she is attracted to! If John will not learn that - then you should get new friends!","Can you really love yourself first? Because, if not, do your homework! You cannot truly love somebody else if it's not working for yourself! Second point, do you really trust the person you want to start the relationship? Because, if not, do your homework! Trust is the most important basis of every relationship, and even more if it is about a romantic relationship! Third thought is - can you talk with that person about _anything_? Because, if not... it will be a hard time when things don't work as you expected. Lastly, do not confuse yourself by mixing up ""romantic relationship"" and ""ownership"" - nobody can own a human being! If you think you could change your partners character, or that she/he just needs to accustom to your behaviour, than it is about owning/manipulating somebody and you should stop it (and leave the relationship). The person of your desire should feel completely free for themself when they will spend time with you - and still they should want to spend time with you (because you let them feel free, _completely_) -> if the person still desires you, thant it is about true love! 

Yes i've found all of that in my life and i feel like the happiest person on earth! <3"
Male,No,"John should move forward with it, at least as long as the risk of alienating his friend(s) is acceptable to him.  As for his family, if they respect him, then they will respect his choices.","Personality, common interests, life goals (children, job, relocation, etc.).  Obviously many of these can't be determined until after starting a relationship vs. pursuing."
Male,Maybe,"Oh Jesus Christ, I think about this everyday. So let me say this: If I was John? Then I'd be the very happiest person in the whole world. If I was mark however? I would become acholic.

If my family was racist then I'd just leave the for her. I wouldn't let my family control my life based on something so, so very silly and goofy.

Side note: The question above is a maybe, because I know I should disagree with it, but I also know that's it's how I would act in love and war. I don't know if that made any sense, I'm sorry.","That either of you are ready to be in love. If one of you or (god forbid) BOTH of you aren't ready for it, then something truly, truly beautiful can decompose into something that's truly, truly heartbreaking."
Other,No,"If John and Rebecca have mutual feelings for each other, then they should move forward with their relationship passionately regardless of outside opinions or factors.
","Does this person make you happy? Do you make this person happy? Do you want to spend the rest of your life with this person? If yes, proceed. If no or maybe, then remain friends but pursue your life spark!"
Male,No,"The person you decide to share a life with is the most important person in your life. From the description I can only tell that John's family and his friend are a toxic environment. So, of course John should try to begin a relationship. There's no guarantee that it will be a succeded relationship but at least he should try. He already looks like a person who thinks wider than his family as he can look at Rebecca not through the prejudice, and he has more empathy than his friend who doesn't think about his feelings. If there is some healthy ground in John's relations with his friend and his family they will work on their bond. If not, those are toxic relations that supress him. ","Well, there are many things but mostly they depend on the person's sensitivity. There are people who would be traumatised by the pursuing in the failed romantic relationship. But there are people who would go through them without a permament damage. But in general it's all about self-care and self-safety. You need to feel safe in the relationship. Any situation when a person feels uncomfortable shouldn't be ignored. A romantic relationship should be equal -if the partner doesn't make you feel safe, it's probably the wrong partner."
Male,No,"From my understanding, this quote means that when people are in love or when they are fighting in a war, they can do anything to win. So for me, I've to disagree with this, due to the fact that there are some things that are never okay to do, even if you are in love or fighting in a war.",Happiness and Security 
Male,No,John should pursue the relationship,"Common attraction, similar interests"
Other,No,"John is in a tought spot, but regardless about what his family or what his friend will think, he should persue his desires, because nobody knows what future stores for us. Maybe his friends and family will ok with it, maybe not, but all that matter is John's own fellings, because it's his life after all.","A bit of the apperence of the person, but mostly, what matter the most, is the person personallity. Seeing if all of the personallity, the good part and the bad part, compliment you own person, if it's fit your own life style."
Female,No,Rebecca should stay with the Man what she wants,"Love , response, happiness,"
Male,Maybe,Il mondo è colorato di suo ma sembra solo vanità.,Non stare a considerare troppo...
Male,Maybe,"John should propose to Rebecca, but it’d depends based on the strength of the friendship with Mark. Did Mark talked to John about this? And also Rebecca has feelings for John, either way the result will be Rebecca staiying with John","if pursuing, connections of that someone else to your personal life, the kind of boundaries set at the beginning, and also the unexpectancy of the human nature and life. But it’d also bring an ethical and moral dilemma about the orginal partner’s feelings, the grudge that comes with regretting your decision, or the frustration that will naturally comes into the second relationship, for being treated as a “second”"
Female,No,"If that’s how John feels, he can tell her how he feels. I don’t think he should let his family stop him, it is his life and if he chooses to be with someone he likes, he can go for it. As for his friends, I think he should at least say something to them, to let them know he plans to ask Rebecca out. That way they don’t end up surprised. If they were really his friends, they would let John date her. ","Trust, honesty, fairness, boundaries, kindness and loyalty I feel like are the biggest ones. Personally I’ve never been in one but I think a relationship should include these things so that both sides would be fair to each other and they support each other. Without these, there would be problems within a relationship and it wouldn’t be good for the mental health overall. "
Prefer not to say,Yes,"Only 2 big thoughts really.
1. Mark can feel envious, in fact it's totally normal given the circumstances but if he were a good friend he wouldn't let jealousy get in the way of being happy for his friend
2. If John's family is not approving of Rebecca due to her skin color, John should examine and recognize that his family may not be worth his own happiness with his own life choices. Perhaps John would be better off cutting them off.","They should first and foremost see if they are attracted to the other person physically. If not, it's not the end of the world but it's a baseline thing for most people. They should have something in common, they don't have to, but it's easier to start conversations with someone you have similar ground with, it's also easier to be interested while the other is talking if they're talking about something you care about yourself. They should consider how the relationship will impact their other relationships, familial or otherwise, and weigh pros and cons. They should also see if the other person is willing to communicate and solve problems in a good way, and see if the other person has any habits or things they may not like. Overall it's very complicated, but those are my first thoughts."
Male,Maybe,"i believe John should seek his happiness, if his family or friends get in his way, that's just to say that they will not care about John",if the other person can make him happy or not
Other,No,He'd still pursue the relationship. Love is love after all and if both are happy together that should be fine. Of course John and Mark need to have a talk beforehand to set things straight and to possibly find a peaceful solution together.,Whether the partner completes the other like a missing piece of the puzzle
Female,Maybe,"The family not approving the relationship due to the skin color is nasty to say the least. John shouldn't let that stop pursuing the relationship. On the other hand, getting with Rebecca knowing well that his friend has feelings for her has me unsure. If one's friend dated their crush knowing well how they felt, can feel like a betrayal. But Mark can't be entitled to Rebecca, after all she showed interest in a relationship with John. I guess best would be to talk about it with the friend.","How well you get along, personality, if it is appropriate, friends opinions (though not in all cases)."
Male,No,"Funny...
So let's say a guy named Frederic likes a girl named Anne-Marie. She is 6 years younger (he is 23 at the time). Extremely shy, he was seduced by her, since she made him understand that she liked him. I should point out that she wants to leave her parents' home, as she does not get along with her father at all...
When she is of age, she comes to live with him...
Frederic is then extremely happy to introduce her to his family. His mother is reluctant, finding her too young for him. She tells him that she is not made for him. But Frederic doesn't listen, and announces that it will be with her, or else he won't come back home...
Years go by, perfect love for Frederic, Anne-Marie being in perfect symbiosis with him in everything...
Marriage, 3 children, Frederic rises in rank and introduces his colleague and best friend to his wife. Everything goes so well, that the colleague comes 3 times a week, and they even celebrate all the holidays together...
Now, guess what happens next...

","Are we strong enough for a break-up or divorce...?
If not, it is better to remain friends..."
Prefer not to say,Yes,"This situation is quite interesting, maybe John should stand up to his family because its his decision who to love. If John's friends are real friends they would be happy for him and if Mark has feelings for Rebecca as well then I guess his chances are over.","We should be aware of everyone else around to not hurt anyone's feelings, when I was in a relationship we were very wary not to let anyone know ( except our parents ) so it doesn't become annoying, if people start knowing about a relationship you'll be in the daily gossip."
Prefer not to say,Maybe,"I think John should go for it. 
If Mark (or other friends) are not happy with that they had to do the first move. 
The main problem is the family and depends of the relationship of John with them.","To trust one another, and to be stimulated in every way."
Female,No,"If John wants to pursue a relationship with Rebecca, and Rebecca reciprocates, then they should try things out and see if they work well together.

Superficial traits, such as ethnicity and gender, shouldn't impede one from pursuing a relationship with someone, let alone be an excuse to strongly dislike someone. If John's family disowns him for wanting to be with a woman of a different ethnicity, that's their lost, not his.

There's not enough information to gauge how envious John's other friends will be of him in regards to Rebecca (minus Mark). If their level of jealousy is ""playful"", as in they would say such things as ""Oh man, your girlfriend is so hot! I wish I were you!"", then it may not be that big of a concern. If their level of jealousy is ""serious"", as in they would say such things as ""She should've been my girlfriend! You don't deserve her!"", then it would be wise for John to either have a conversation with his friends, or cut ties with them. It would also be wise for him to keep an eye on Mark, to make sure he doesn't do anything harmful to either John or Rebecca.","Firstly, discern what it is that attracts you to that person. Is it due to superficial reasons, such as height, eye/hair/skin color, and fitness? Or is it due to deeper reasons? Do you find their laugh infectious, and just hearing it fills you with joy? Do they show kindness to everyone around them, even when the world drives them nuts, and it strives you to want to be better in turn? If you're attracted to the former, then you're pursuing them for the wrong reasons. If you're attracted to the latter, then continue your pursuit.

Secondly, does the person in question reciprocate the attraction? If they do not, in any compacity, then end your pursuit. No amount of insistence will change their mind, and any continuation will end in a severed connection at best. If they do, then take that leap of faith. Figure out how your relationship works, and whether or not it does work."
Male,Maybe,"The detail with Rebecca being ""extremely beautiful"" is unnecessary and seems misogynistic.
Regardless of Rebecca's appearance, if John thinks she would make a good partner and Rebecca is like minded, he should pursue her. It doesn't matter what Mark or John's family thinks because the person who this decision affects is John (and Rebecca). 
Mark didn't make a move sooner or he already tried and failed to impress Rebecca, either way his opinion matters very little. John's family doesn't have to live with or have an intimate relationship with Rebecca or John so who cares? John and Rebecca certainly shouldn't.","Cohabitation, reproduction, morals, and values. Can you live with them? Are you sexually compatible? Do your life morals and values line up similarly enough? All these things should be greenlit by all parties before you get into a romantic relationship. "
Male,Maybe,"Here it is more a question of moral choice, since on the one hand John starts dating Rebecca, but on the other hand he loses his friendship with Mark, since Mark will in any case be extremely depressed by this set of circumstances. If Rebekah has made a choice toward John and loves him, then John must reciprocate those feelings, as they are mutual. And it doesn't matter what the parents think about it, because it's not up to them to choose who their son loves. ","Trust, understanding and respect for each other. Without these things no relationship can last long."
Male,Yes,"Life taught me that you have to do the things that make you feel good without depending on anyone or anything. As long as you don't break or violate your values, anything goes.","One must first consider their well-being, the goal is to feel good about the decision you make when trying to have a relationship with someone. Then the factors that will make life together enjoyable, objectives, goals, interests, tastes, etc. must be considered."
Other,Maybe,John should go out on a date with her,"Keep jealousy away ,Manage stress ect."
Female,Maybe,"John Could State That He And Mark Are Interested In Rebecca, But Not To Hurt Each Other Feelings, They Kept Their Jealousy To Themselves.","1. Ask If They Are Single, 2. Make Proper Greetings With His/Her's Family & Friends, 3. Treat Each Other With Respect And You'll Get Respect Back From Them."
Male,Maybe,John should pursue Rebecca as the feelings are mutual and there's other people for Mark in the future. John can be the first in his family to break the racism whether it means going on his own or not which will better future generations of the family line. ,"They should take into mind whether feelings are mutual as to not force a relationship, and take into mind if that love interest would be good overall for their well being (financial, emotional, mental, physical). "
Female,Yes,he should do it because skin doesn't matter,go anther who you want like I'm a lesbian and I have a girlfriend so yeah
Prefer not to say,Yes,"His family should approve because all lives matter, John should weigh the value of the relationship  and the value of friendship of his friends to see if he should pursue this relationship.","First off, you should think about your feelings and the other personne’s, then you should always think about the consequences (good/bad) and then think of what you should do before you act."
Other,No,"I would want to know if John loves Rebecca, or just lusts after her. if he loves her for more than her good looks, i think his friends envy would be misplaced.",the most important thing is the other person making you happy
Male,Yes,I will not make a decision because my parents also don't approve,be always understanding to your partner in all things
Female,Maybe,I think  if John have feelings for Rebbeca then he should begin a relationship with her if he wants to and don’t worry about his relationship not being accepted by friends or family.,"I think some things to consider are trust, communication, support, openness and acceptance of who your partner is, in a relationship."
Male,Yes,"It'd shouldn't matter what your family thinks of a person. If they hate her because of skin color you either A, cut ties with them for basically racist behaviour. B, sit the family down and lay it on the line. Tell them if they can't overcome their racist tendencies they will no longer be a part of your life. C, if you think that your family will be harmful towards her because of her skin color, you might have to put aside your feelings, let Mark proceed towards his relationship with her, and tell his family because of their racist attitudes they cost him a potential life partner.","There's really not much. Mostly that you and your interest are respectful of each other, try to understand where they're coming from, commit fully to that person, no straying. If your family is against it, see previous answer, at the end of the day it's all about your life and your happiness. No one but yourself, and your potential love interest matters."
Male,No,Always care for other people's feelings and this sounds like a big mess waiting to happen. Love and relationships need healthy environments and there is none there.,"The pursuit is the problem. It has to just happen. It can't be forced or arranged in a society not governed by those same standards anymore. Or really ever was the right choice, cuz then someone or both just settle with who they meet and feel shortchanged. Can of worms...."
Male,Maybe,"I dont know, he will either consider her feelings or his parent's. The choice may be hard but it is not mine to make.",They should just consider that their partner is also a human being and respect them.
Male,No,"Relationships are often challenging, some more than others. Knowing your family won't approve of a partner isn't going to make things easy, but it is hard to judge based solely on the information provided, with different cultures addressing the skin color issue.
Envy can be an ugly thing, but is also very human. Having serious doubts about a potential relationship is also human.
I label myself as grey-romantic and grey-sexual, and I would suggest John seek someone else to ask advice of, but ultimately, no one can make such a decision for him (even if the decision is to follow the advice of someone else, such as in the case of arranged marriage.)","Sexual attraction, age gap, language barriers, compatibility in personality, financial responsibility, political stance, friend group, shared interests, red flags."
Male,Maybe,He should be honest with her and his family because that is his life.,Make sure you tell the person you love that you care for them because that's the right thing to do 
Male,Maybe,"I'll say, that, honestly, the information should be kept secret. Consider moving in another country (if you're old enough), and seven years later, just come back and the whole job is in the hat.","This was rules my mom teached. Number one; See the parents, be as a guest. Two; live together for a day or two, and see how good things roll around. Three; if anything goes wrong, evacuate."
Female,Yes,"Just go ahead, never letting external stressor to divide your love. Never decide your will according to the peer pressure. Everything that is agreed on both sides is considered bond.",Agreement on both sides. Run away to start a new life when its endangered.
Female,Yes,If John wants Rebecca truly then Boone else should matter but if it's only out of envy then it will never work,If it is truly what the heart wants go for it no matter what others think
Prefer not to say,Maybe,John should follow what his heart ses and should choose the best option for this situation.,"kindness, having things in common with there partner and making sure there relation ship is a healthy one."
Male,Yes,Well technically there are two options. but i always do what my mind said to me it can be starting a relationship with her or not. but considering the situation there is a high chance for start a relationship. only problem is family. but we cant decide what will happen next. we can do is stand with our choices. everything is not be positive all the time we had to deal with it. i think best option is start a relationship. family will changed later. and mark is not a problem at all. we all try to catch the fish but the guy who catch it keep its. simple theory that all the boys respect.    ,"trust is the only thing i consider. without trust nothing will be happen
"
Male,Yes,If John and Rebecca both have feelings for each then Mark has to accept that. He should tell his feelings to Rebecca and let her know there is a choice.,"Compatibility, goals, values, religion"
Female,Yes,"Trust your thoughts, if its just to make your friends envious dont. When you meet her if she is respectful, kind and doesnt treat anyone like trash then it is okay. If they dont like you, dont force them into a relationship for your will.","They would consider if they are pure hearted for you not just for something you have. Dont force them into a relationship. Think before you do anything, even in if its not a relationship "
Male,Yes,love is simple if u feel love express it ;like life some times. is urs sometimes its not…,only consider the mental state the person is …
Male,Yes,"John's parenst should let him have a love relationship with Rebecca,because they can't cut a relationship becuase they don't agree it.","First get a friendship or try to chat with them,for example."
Male,Maybe,"It depends on whether Jonh lives with his parents, or not. Is he an adult or not.
Now I'm going to assume that he is an adult.
John should ignore the circumstances and move on to Rebecca. 
If John is financially independent, he can easily do that, if not, it's complicated by his dependence on them.
He may regret it for the rest of his life if he doesn't try with Rebecca.","The rules of the relationship should be discussed.
What you would expect from each other, what your needs are.
This should be clarified as soon as possible.
This is especially important if there is going to be sex, but it doesn't have to be quick, but it can be a sweet way to get there.
Of course, this is not a hard and fast rule if you are passionate from the first moment. Better to satisfy than to stifle, and to wear masks in front of each other just for the sake of convention. Because it's a lie."
Female,Yes,"I think they should go for it anyways, if they both like each other and are in love then it shouldn't matter. All that matters is that they are happy, it shouldn't bother anyone else.","Is the maturity difference okay, will you be able to make time for each other and pay attention to each others love languages. Can you understand the other person? "
Female,Maybe,beauty is skin deep. respect others but love who you want to and the rest can fuck off.,I dunno.
Male,Yes,It kind of depends on the person himself like is Mark or was it John is technically a good person and not just some dirtbag trying to go under Rebecca's panties and do any of the three characters have anything that we could relate to at that moment.,"Three things: Honesty, Trust and Confidence!"
Male,No,If I were John I wouldn't let my friends jealousy and my family's racism stop me from loving a woman and making her mine. They can feel as disgusted by my decisions as they'd like but it won't change the fact that I love her. ,There will always be ups and downs. If there aren't any then something is wrong and it should be dealt with. If you don't love yourself before getting into a relationship your relationship is destined for failure. Always listen to your gut it never lies.
Male,No,If John really loves Rebecca then he should be honest about his feelings and tell her how he feels ,"People should consider each other's feelings, sacrifices, and time "
Female,Yes,I think it's beautiful ,That they should stick with each other for life
Male,No,Would tell Rebecca about my feelings. Would also tell my family and friends about my decision.,"Honesty, embrace the other's imperfections, let the Partner be himself / herself "
Male,No,John should just kill them all and tenderize the meat to later fillet and preserve as his survival food stores during the coming apocalypse. ,"How they will taste and can most of the cadaver be preserved before putrification sets in. Also, will their face make a good dead skin mask and/or at least an opaque lampshade."
Male,Yes,"It is nobody's business who loves who, especially on skin color. Unfortunately for Mark, Rebecca never gave any advances on him, not like either boy was asking her out to begin with. John shouldn't feel ashamed of who he likes and Mark should take people's attraction to him in strides.","Be as direct as possible. Don't be vague on things you want or need, because you'll just start infighting/disagreements like in the story above."
Male,Yes,"John should respect his family's wishes and not pursue a relationship with Rebecca. Choosing Rebecca would result in estranging himself from both his friend Mark and his family. Furthermore, his children would have an identity crisis because they were from different backgrounds. ","Beauty, respect, love, romance, loyalty "
Female,Yes,"John should start a relationship with Rebecca as his feelings are reciprocated. It is not right to allow racist families to control your love life. Friends can share attractions, but that does not always mean the friends are as accepted in their attraction. It may end a friendship but then the friendship was not as strong as desired. ","If your beliefs line up, if the attraction is mutual, if you can handle their mental or physical health problems if they exist, if your goals are supported by the other person"
Male,No,"I believe that if you really love the person, you will fight for that love even in the face of adversity. Nothing in this life is easy, it requires effort, dedication, persistence, recency and being brave. I still think that John's family is wrong to discriminate against someone because of their skin color.","Well, in this section it depends a lot on the person in question. Personally, I think it is someone who loves you for who you are and not so much for what you have, that the relationship is based on communication, trust. That is someone who helps you grow personally, at the same time is a suitable help and that both complement each other. If it is possible that they share something in common and that they enjoy together, that mutual respect is a value between the couple."
Other,Yes,"John should stop being a coward and tell his feelings. If his friends get envious of the fact that he got the girl who like him and now he's happy, they were never his true friends in the first place. True friends celebrate your happiness and success, they don't get envious of you.  As for the skin colour part, he should talk about it with his family. It'll take time, but at the end of the day, his parents will realise they just want their son to be happy","If I were crazed enough to consider a romantic relationship with someone and if someone was equally crazed to consider one with me, I need the following:

1. My own independence and freedom: It's like oxygen. Can't be without it.
2. Honesty: Again, nothing is going to work if they aren't blunt and upfront with me.
3. Loyalty: I mean, who doesn't want it?
4. Similar interests as me: Otherwise what would we talk about? Random gossip? UGH!"
Other,No,I really think this situation is overwhelming because every decision john does has a negative outcome in the end,Prepare for the worst
Male,Yes,I think John might have trouble being in love with Rebecca.,Strike when the iron is hot.
Male,Maybe,"You have not given enough information about Rebecca to make a judgment, but normally love / lust trumps raace.",The character situation of the other person and are they compatible. 
Other,Maybe,John leaves his stupid ass family and starts a polyamorous relationship with Rebecca and Mark!,that i am clinically insane
Male,Maybe,Hard to say,"For starters, a partner must be supportive, being there for their partner when they need it, to offer comfort "
Other,Maybe,"He should just date her and cut off his family. I mean, if they're racist why even care about them tbh. Also his friends while envious, should still try to stick by him. Befriending a woman just to date her and when it doesn't succeed leave her should just fuck off fr. Uhhh anyways John should date her because it'll work out for him and he can just get rid of those who don't like it because he can control who he interacts with in his life idk man. If Mark starts to hate him just because of this then was it really that great of a friendship. I mean sure he can be jealous but he should learn to let it be and if he doesn't then just get rid of him too ┐⁠(⁠´⁠ー⁠｀⁠)⁠┌ ","Idk I've never been in one but uhhh communication is important, if you're having a problem talk it out or else it won't be fixed. Or it could just straight up ruin the relationship if you don't communicate. Be sure to care for each other's needs and not to overstep boundaries, well, yeah start by setting basic boundaries. If your partner starts to control every part of your life, including trying to isolate you then you should seek help from a friend or family member to make it easier to break it off. Remember, if you end up in an abusive relationship it's not your fault and you can make it out. Ummm uh make sure to have time for yourself as well, a relationship doesn't always have to be so codependent, it's fine to spend time by yourself away from your partner occasionally. Um idk what else I've never dated I just see relationships ermm break up if you start to hate them or whatever don't stay in a relationship that you feel is going nowhere ."
Male,No,feelings of love usually mean its feelings towards a sexual attraction so either john or mark or both have to get it out of their system to not loose their companionship over something like 'romantic' love so that they arent jealous or angry at each other after rebecca made a choice.,if they are actually sexual in nature and not romantic as described in books and other media. getting to know someone is deeper than just mere romance and sexuality. a true bond goes beyond that.
Male,Maybe,"I think John should go after Rebecca. His friends, including Mark can’t blame him for her wants. With the family not accepting her skin color, that’s their problem, not John’s or Rebecca’s","Their interests and passions, mindset/mind state, personality traits, and morals/principles they stand on"
Male,Yes,"Honestly, I'm two ways about this situation. I don't think it would be a good idea because first this could possibly cause disputes among different parents of different race due to their family member's interracial relationship, which can sort to possible racism, albeit hidden in attitude or straight to the point in front of different family members, and the thought of the parent's grandchildren from that child being introduced to different culture led by that parent of it can bother them, thus can create familial issues even if their children decided to marry each other despite their color. 


But. if John is attracted to Rebecca and Rebecca has the same feelings for him, then you can't exactly make them change their mind, you just have to let them go and accept it as how it is, especially if they are independent.
Friends who are envious and jealous of one because of their relationship with the other proves that they are not the ones for you. A real friend would respect their decision and be happy for that person, a real friend won't take your happy life away to benefit their own.
For John's parents, if he and Rebecca choose to continue their relationship with a different other this way and even decided to be engaged later on, they will have to respect and accept his decision. John and Rebecca's parents will have to do the best to remain positive and to be close with one another.","Personally, what I would suggest is a person of a certain ethnic pursuing a relationship with someone like them(Ex. Black male with a Black Female)Because interracial relationships can be another, secret way of breeding out people of color(Most significantly, African people), as apparently it takes 4 generations of people from the same interracial relationships to completely erase the melanin from the person's skin, making them a white race.

Another thing, when people pursuing a romantic relationship, they have to take time with each other before going any further, meaning that they have to find a reason to be together by getting to know each other, see if they have common interest, hangout places, meet families, and do the best to be social with each other by communicating with one another before they decide if they are worth getting engaged to.


Also, for Men in a relationship with women, they must remember that females are first come first serve, meaning they have to do be a service for them all the time, since they're usually the ones taking them out somewhere, like for instance in a restaurant they open doors for her, assigned and help serve seats for them, and they must pay for all the dating expenses so that way she doesn't do all the work, saving time for them and make them feel like they are special, as they should be treated as such.

Lastly, relationships should be fixed and handled by two partners, should there be conflict with one another, for instance, if one partner is wrong about something and the other points out the flaws and they remembered, they must apologize for the mistake and do the best to ease the womb. Refusal to solve problems in a relationship can result in more conflict, fights, and aggression with one another, whether be physical, mental, or emotional.

 This is especially a problem in a marriage because it can lead to heartbreaks, distrust, and separation from one another, which can lead up to a divorce, this can especially hurt couples with children because it can have an impact on their lives, one would want to stop the arguing because they don't understand what's going on and think that they are fighting for no reason as well as gain peace of mind so they either tell parents to quiet down or mentally want it to stop, one could blame one of the parents for starting the argument and with times of siding with one parent, can result them believing the other parent is the problem. 
Kids must be educated by wise, understanding parents on relationships, the logics of it, and the results of it.
"
Female,Yes,"I believe John shouldn't just ignore Rebecca or his feelings just because of how his family feels for her skin color, especially since she said she likes him. I also believe that he should not allow what his friends feel stop him either.","I have not been in a romantic relationship yet, but I think possibly whether they like the person for their character or their looks, since if they haven't seen what the person is really like, they may regret ending up in a relationship later. as i said earlier,i have not been in a romantic relationship nor do i intend on being in one soon, but i think is something i think would be important"
Female,Maybe,"I think John’s values has a lot to do in this situation. While he is attracted to her, is he ready or willing to upset and perhaps affect his parents in some way and his social dynamic with his friends? Is he taking Rebecca’s thoughts into mind when they follow through with their relationship? While I cannot speak about which course of action is right (because the current circumstances around him do not make his actions wrong) there are some actions related to his situation that people can deem as distasteful such as being boastful about “bagging” Rebecca and rubbing salt in the wounds of Mark. I think that as long as John has taken these things in consideration, and is aware of the consequences and still intends to pursue Rebecca, he should be free to make his own decisions.","My answer might be a bit different. Loving is free. But when choosing a person to be in a committed romantic relationship with, there are many things to consider other than emotional compatibility, attractiveness, family, personality, and financial status. I feel that it is important for couples to mostly be on the same page in their lives. Circumstances such as that of John’s with Mark I deem to be external but the importance of this situation lies on how John deeply feels about his friend. I don’t really like to police people’s morals, especially when it comes to a topic easily complicated like this, but I think that as much as possible, do not hurt people unless it really can’t be helped (like, do not bring others to cheat or do not stalk)."
Male,No,Skin color plays no part in my decision.  What's right for her and I is what counts. If the family really cares it's about what's right. ,"Do they really feel for that person or is it for looks, prestige,or just to get back at somebody.  "
Female,Yes,"I believe interracial relationships are just as important as ""normal"" relationships. If John truly loved this woman and would like to begin a relationship with Rebecca, he should ask her out on a date. If it goes well, it goes well. If it doesn't, it doesn't.

Should the date go well and John is hesitant about introducing her to his family, assuming said family is white and strict, I'd suggest they wait until the time is right. If they warm up to the idea of an interracial relationship with no judgements, John should bring his lady friend over more often for holidays or visits. If they choose not to accept it, his family isn't worth pleasing.

And if it works out, John and Mark should talk to each other about their feelings regarding the woman they both loved. It's going to be excruciatingly painful for both parties, but it gets stuff off of their shoulders. Certain men get petty when they don't get what they want. ","No matter who you are, your partner should be willing to accept your flaws with no judgement, be willing to help whenever they can, and if they truly loved you, they would never base your flaws as your main personality. Your partner should treat you like a human being, not an object.

The most important thing to remember is, COMMUNICATION IS KEY. Nobody likes talking because they assume it makes things worse, but in my experience, it does AND doesn't. It doesn't because with your partner, you can be completely honest with them, no matter how much it hurts them. If they take it personally, it's on them, not you. But remember to keep your cool too.

If neither is willing to be honest, they're not ready for a relationship, let alone ready to be in a relationship with one another. If anything, they're better off being friends.

Certainly, no relationship is perfect, so not only does your partner need to understand that you have limits, you need to understand THEY have limits too. Romance is tricky, and I'm still trying to figure that out, being a single woman in her 20s. I'm a hopeless romantic, so I believe everyone deserves at least one soulmate."
Male,Yes,John should try to form a relationship with Rebecca because true love is the best thing that can exist.,"They should consider if the relationship is authentic, has promise for creating a family, and the two people share an identical goal and worldview in life."
Female,No,"If Rebecca seems to be into John then John should tell her. She may not like Mark. And if Mark is indeed a good friend, then he would get over it for the sake of both John and Rebecaa. If Mark loved Rebecca enough, he would want her to be happy. And if John is whats going to make her happy then so be it.
If John's parents are racist, that shouldn't mean he can't date Rebecca. If they won't show support, then he doesn't need it. He can get on just fine with just Rebecca and himself.","They should share some of your important views. Doens't have to be all, sometimes its good to be challenged, but they should share some of your core beliefs. You wouldn't want a guy who is sexist or racist or homophobic/transphobic. You also want a guy who is quiet and doesn't give into peer pressure. A guy who doesn't push you around and who isn't pushed around by others. A guy is reasonable enough to make good choices, but not so much that he can't dream big."
Male,Maybe,It is silly for real friends to fight over a girl. Let her decide instead. John's parents must not judge Rebeca because of her skin color.,Take a time to actually know the person before making a big leap like this.
Female,Yes,"If john truly loves her, he could react in two ways. Either confess and let her know the situation to let her go, Or admit and ignore the ridicule.",1. Body language. 2. Interest in favorable subjects. 3. Respect boundaries and opinions. 4. Talk together about love languages 
Female,No,"depends on how much he loves her, and how much she loves him, if its just physical attraction it isnt worth loosing family and friends, but if this bond is unbreakable, then maybe go for it, but it truly depends on how well you are connected to your family, and how you know your friends will react, if mark wont let it go then maybe he wasn't a good friend to begin with, and the other guys most likely wont be jealous just proud, or that's how most guys ive seen react, all the guys that ive met that truly get jealous arent right in the mind and are genuinely lonely quite sad.","a genuine emotional connection, dont strive to be perfect to appeal to someone else, if they truly love you, they will love you in your worst and in your best, most physical relationships dont last long, since there is no mental connection or communication"
Male,Yes,"Live you own life. Make decisions, and deal with the consequences.",Mutuality
Female,No,"Whether or not Mark likes her doesn’t matter unless Rebecca also likes Mark. If Rebecca does like Mark and John it’s still her choice to date whomever she wishes and it’s the responsibility of the hurt party to tend to their own feelings about the situation. It’s not the responsibility of John or Rebecca to fix Marks feelings. As for the family issue, John needs to be upfront about that so Rebecca doesn’t develop deep feelings for him before discovering his family situation. ","People need to know the difference between lust, limerence, obsession and love. "
Male,No,"I'm sure this social dilemma could make for a great dramatic series if done well enough. I think in order to solve this potentially painful situation with the least harm, John should consider his values and communicate them to those involved (Rebecca, Mark, his family). Communication of intent and awareness of others' perceptions of that intent are vital to avoiding the worst outcomes (broken friendships, grudges, familial schisms, etc). Easy advice to give, perhaps harder to follow.","It depends on the specifics of the situation of course, but at minimum I think people should question their own reasons for pursuing a relationship before deciding to. I.e ""why do I want this?"", ""what am I hoping to get from this?"" as well as ""what kind of person would I want to be in a romantic relationship with?"""
Female,Maybe,"John would simply have to step up to make the first move to establish his relationship. The fact that John's family would not approve of her might stop Rebecca herself more so than John himself whom can go against his family in this compared to a stranger who Rebecca would be at this moment. As well as with the family of John not approving, and John knowing his friends would be envious, it is up to John to decide whether he wants to keep his friends in a less strained relationship or more so by dating Rebecca to which his friends would be jealous over, even then, if they are true friends, they wouldn't do much to harm John's relationship with them or Rebecca, however John is the only one who knows this aside from his friends themselves so whether he makes the move is entirely up to him and so on.","Mutuality, both can share a burden, trust, boundaries, equality, and so on."
Male,No,If john really likes rebecca he should proceed.  Friends are much easier to replace than a rare opportunity for love.,Shared values and principles.  Similar goals with respect to what kind of life to build together.  Both want kids? when? 
Prefer not to say,No,"If John truly has some form of affection towards Rebecca, he should just confess his feelings to her. Regarding his friend Mark, he’ll understand at some point and be friends again with John if he’s a true friend. 

Regarding the skin color topic, I think John should take a stand for her and have an argumentative conversation with his family so that she’s accepted willingly in his family. If not, just move out and hope for the family to come around coz eventually family does come around. 

John should just tell his feelings right away to Rebecca ","Honesty, mutual respect, intimacy and spending quality time together irrespective of them living together or not. People in a romantic relationship should always keep their partner on same priority as they keep themselves, if that’s not possible for some reason then discuss those reasons out before it’s too late, should cook for each other. 

Never burden responsibility on other person but share along & obviously have an intimate bond."
Female,No,"John should go for it if he is interested in her. While yes, Mark might be jealous of John, Rebecca obviously has feelings for John, meaning Mark would theoretically not stand a chance, and have his heart broken either way. While it’s true John needs to look out for his friends, if his friends already know he has a thing for Rebecca, they’d respect that he and Rebecca should be together, considering thats what she wants. As for John’s family, while it might be nerve wracking to deal with a family with old values, if John genuinely cares for Rebecca, he will stand by her regardless of what his family says. The situation itself just relies on a lot of courage and trust building between people.","Things the other person likes, and doesn’t like to be able to understand ways to do nice things for them in the future. Trusting that person and showing that you trust them. Respecting of boundaries is big, and also helps with trust itself."
Male,No,"Time, our only currency, so do things last week that you're still putting off today; there's not much time, love needs to be on deck, take the rudder and send fear to time out. Also, give Mark a call, better yet, invite him to the poop deck for a beer to clear the air.","Time is fast, but love needs a slower gait. By all means be yourself, try to resist the urge for  façade. Watch how they treat others, observe the company they keep, play matchmaker for yourself, be keenly aware of any clues, folks show themselves if you pay attention. By all means, do not jump head over heals, remember if it's meant to be it will."
Male,No,"
that the girl should only choose to one of the guys","Don't being toxic, evite harassment or envy, and more answers."
Female,Maybe,"Jhon should not be afraid to say his feelings, nor to tell Rebecca the situation, if he really loves her, he will be with her, regardless of what others say, not even his parents, it is his life. Your decisions. No one should get in the way, or change it. And yes Mark, he is someone mature, or understanding, if the girl he likes likes someone else, he must understand and accept things as they are, to be happy.","Have things in common, Understanding, Kindness, Maturity, If they get married, they must have a good economy, Confidence, Care, Self-love and above all... Nothing, or handle jealousy."
Male,Maybe,"John should think about which he cares more about, His family or Rebecca and go from there. John should also figure out whether he loves Rebecca, or is feeling lust for her ","One must think of whether interests clash, would that person be a good fit, and is one ready to start a relationship "
Other,Maybe,"I believe that John should confess his feelings either way. It should not matter what his family thinks (assuming they are all adults) based on skin colour, his feelings should matter to him and to Rebecca.","I am not a romantic person myself nor would I consider being in one, but I strongly believe that the people pursuing a relationship should feel security and comfortability in their relationship(s). That is the most important aspects that should be considered."
Male,Yes,A man should not let anyone influence his decisions and should stand on his own to feet if he is a scared little boy he will run home to mommy and if he is a man he will choose what is right for him and stand by it ,"you should definitely consider if the interests of both parties align and if it does not that it does not conflict with each others interests, religion could be problematic for certain religions,   a persons background also plays a role so if both parties have extremely different backgrounds it could become problematic later on in the relationship"
Female,Maybe,"John should first talk with Mark to make his intentions known. If Rebecca and John want to be together, Mark needs to do the right thing and wish them well. (Rebecca already doesn’t want to be with him, so it costs Mark nothing to be cool; but might cost him his friends if he can’t accept defeat graciously.) If John is worried about how an interracial relationship would affect his family, he should feel the situation out before telling them about it. Obviously bigotry and racism aren’t acceptable, but if John doesn’t think he can handle people disapproving, he should reconsider being with Rebecca — maybe set her up with Mark? :)","They should consider whether the person has similar goals — if one person wants to just date and mess around, and the other is looking to get married and have kids, there’s bound to be an issue. It’s also important whether their personalities mesh well, whether the other person has any personal dealbreakers, and how trustworthy the person is if the relationship is to succeed."
Female,Yes,"If John’s family wouldn’t improve the relationship even by Rebecca’s skin color, so be it. What matters is how much they went to be for each other no matter what ",Taking the relationship seriously by getting to know each other’s personal details of their lives 
Male,No,lmao go do it if mark was a true one he wouldnt be jealous also racism bad,if you are emotionally mature to pursue one
Female,Maybe,"They should be together anyways, life is short",The ability and willingness to deal with their past trauma and heal 
Male,Maybe,it is still necessary to know if their relationship will last,"confidence, wanting a family life"
Other,No,"If they're not happy for em they're not real friends.
Same is for his family - what does he care wether or not they approve? If they can't accept his relationship JUST because of skin color then just cut off contact with em. They'll always have something to pick on.","just don't be creepy, be yourself and don't let yourself be influenced by e.g. your families judgement or how your friends would feel if you yourself think it's the right person. And if they reject you, take it. No is no."
Female,No,"I'd say choose happiness. As long as you don't seriously hurt another person, it doesn't really matter. Especially because of the racist family. F*ck them. Be with people you love and care about and leave everything else behind. Life is stressfull enough. ","To love the other person for who they are, not the idea you might have of them.
To not give up if things get difficult, stay a team and work together.
Remember that it is more than okay if you and your partner like different things! As long as you can enjoy spending time with each other and are open to trying new things or the things your partner likes!
Falling in love is easy but loving someone in good and bad times is what's important. 

P.S: I feel like I could tell you a lot more things but I keep it at this for now. 
I hope I could help a little bit. Enjoy your day! <3"
Prefer not to say,No,"There is a lot of prejudice and insecurity inherent in the macho culture in this story. 
",find what makes you happy
Prefer not to say,Maybe,I don’t really have any thoughts on it this is sorta a normal thing I see with the people at my school.,To be true to there partner even if they arnt true to you.
Female,Maybe,"I think it doesn't matter what skin color you have, if you love the person, you can love them",Some people like a kind people or a smart people when pursuing a romantic relationship with someone else
Female,Maybe,"Well since this situation is similar to what I have dealt with, I just left my family. Cut all contact and ties to them and got married to that person I love. 
If a family has such a problem with something as minor and uncontrollabe as skin color they are not people I'd want as family. John should cut ties with such bigots and date the girl. As for the friend of his, if hes a good friend he will know that Rebecca is not a object to be won, she already made a choice on who she loves and he needs to respect that choice. 
Yes it sucks having your heart broken but being envious and possibly acting on such emotions would make him a god awful friend and person. If it comes to that John might need a new friend circle as well.","Well for starters it's in a persons best interest not to entertain stalkers XD or unstable minded people. I can say from experience those that brag to me about harming animals and finding joy in others suffering is not a safe person to be around. Respect and trust should go both ways but it doesn't mean you need to pour out all your darkest secrets. You should be able to feel comfortable enough to talk about your emotions and not have the other person shun you for it as well as doing the same for your partner.
It's also very important to see how your partner treats servers, if they are treating people like waitresses/waiters poorly chances are they will treat you badly in the near future.
Also if the person you are with is cheating on someone else to be with you, they are cheating on you too and you should run and let the other person know."
Male,Yes,"I feel that John should begin a relationship with Rebecca, as not only would they both be happy in the relationship, it would most likely help John distance himself from those who would dampen his happiness, namely his blatantly racist family, and if his friends were true friends, they would support him either way.","I believe personality and affection are key, for you could be dating the most gorgeous guy/gal and it wouldn't mean jack if he/she was an inexcusable jerk. On the other side of the coin, if you decide to get in a relationship with someone purely from lust or a brief crush, it can't last long. Granted, long, happy relationships can stem from such things, but those relationships still need affection to function."
Female,No,I think he should tell her how he feels and start a relationship and never allow his family to disrespect Rebecca.,"Seek to know that person's values, how they were in their past relationships, if that person is toxic."
Other,Maybe,"John should just tell rebecca how he feels. His family doesn’t get to decide how he gets to live his life- and his friends shouldn’t hate him over him just getting into a happy and healthy relationship- even if you have feelings for that person, it doesn’t justify leaving your friend or trying to ruin the relationship.","It shouldn’t be a forced relationship on either sides. Both you and your partner should want to have a relationship with each other, not have one forced upon you."
Male,Maybe,"John's family must learn to adapt to the times, instead of being backwards assholes, John should not allow his family's cuntiness interfere with his personal happiness. ","I *should* not speak for anyone else. What I consider to be important may not be on other's priority list of attributes in seeking a partner. There should be a degree of physical attraction, but it's not everything. Emotional intelligence is big for me. As well as a hunger to learn in general with a healthy amount of skepticism. It think myself as a sapiosexual person. Curiosity is very attractive to me. "
Other,No,Who does Rebecca like? Who is most compatible? Are they willing to let each other be their own people? Will John stick up for her or let his family abuse her? Will Mark leak it to John's family if they try to hide it? There is not nearly enough info here.,"Humans are going to have human moments, you'll be a lot happier with someone who respects you (and not the gross religious respect that requires fear) than someone who can provide but treats you like shit. Ability to provide can change. An asshole rarely sees a need to."
Male,Maybe,"John must continue with the relationship. Mark must be aware that jealousy and envy are not very good for an adult male to have. John and Rebecca might explain this to him, by saying for example that it often led to violence and it is okay to enjoy that two people like each other without trying to infringe on that. Mark can think about that there are 'plenty of fish in the sea', meaning he can look elsewhere.
John knows how trouble between people often proceeds. He might think about how other people in his family might have been judged by their community for loving someone different. In the end, he should find a place where he and Rebecca could be together.","Money, where to live, pets (how many they want, if they want one), how many children, do they have a support circle (family parents willing to look after children some days etc), habits such as cigarette smoking."
Male,Yes,"I'm not good with relationship stuff but from my perspective

John should try to pursue a relationship with Rebecca to know if they are right for each other.

And in time he will know the result


It may result in a succesful relationship or possibly not ","Pursuing a relationship would require both parties to be consentual with each other


Such would be that both would love each other, and would accept each other's quirks and personality. "
Male,Maybe,"it is his family that should learn to be tolerant and respect Jhon personal life.

Male,No,Talk john's familiy into authoring.,Walk in someone else’s shoes
Female,Maybe,"Honestly, I was in this situation but flipped and never told him how I feel and it still bothers me to this day somewhere in the back of my mind.

It still upsets me when I’m laying down at night and over thinking about every insignificant thing that ever happened in my life. Lol ","Be honest, be flexible to opposing opinions, be kind, and take a moment and think about what you’re gonna say before you say it. "
Female,Maybe,"I'd say if John and Rebecca get along well and have common interests, compatible personalities and aspirations in life then John shall ask her out. Screw what his family has to say, if they care about race then they're shallow and not good people at all. And friends shall not envy each others, If they do then they're toxic. Rebecca likes John, John likes Rebecca, I say go for it and do not give importance to others réactions, this is John and Rebecca's lives not anyone else's","Compatible personalities, common interests, communication skills, concessions limits, conflict management, common or compatible sets of values, goals etc. "
Other,Maybe,"Love is complicated, but if you like it, you should fight for it. Those things, like your friend's, will happen. It might hurt, but sometimes you have to think about your happiness.","I'm not that type, I suppose they should be equal and equal to be in a courtship."
Male,Maybe,"Well if John is attracted to or really likes Rebecca and she feels the same way about him then he should go ahead and be with her and be happy together..others don't matter because we know what's best for our life and not others...so go ahead John...get your Rebecca and be very happy

","respect, sincerity, love, and always respecting the partner's individuality and freedom, whether it's him or a woman, it doesn't matter.
"
Other,Yes,"John should tell her how he feels, and how his family and friends feel about her. She should decide with him whether or not it would be worth it to begin a relationship based on their pros and cons.","People should consider how it would impact their life with others, and carefully go over it with their possible partner."
Male,Yes,I think that John should tell her how he feels about her and if John's parents have a problem with it thats there problem because they can't stop him from loving her,"
know they respect your boundaries. feel safe to share your feelings. feel physically safe with them. believe they support your choices"
Male,No,"If John is sure that the relationship with Rebecca will be stable and wonderful, then he shouldn't be bothered by what his friends think, especially if they get  envious of him. If they were real friends for him, they'd just accept the fact that these two are together now and support him instead. ","The thing that the person out of the huge comfort in the relationship might start showing not their best sides, which can push the partner off. Even though, I'm sure there's always a way to work on the flaws in the relationship to stay happy"
Male,Yes,I think John should tell Rebecca how he feels about her and if his parents have a problem with it thats there problem but they cant stop him from loving her,"
know they respect your boundaries. feel safe to share your feelings. feel physically safe with them. believe they support your choices"
Male,Yes,"I feel that despite the hurdles that might get in the way, both John and Rebecca could find a way to make their relationship work. They might get disapproval from their friends and family, but as long as they’re happy together, it's all that really matters. ","One of the most important things I view in a relationship is that both parties must be passionate about each other. As well as helping each other out, and striving to be the best that they can be for each other. "
Male,No,"Maybe discuss this with Rebecca, whether or not pursuing a relationship with all the hurdles it entails is something they both want","Personal values, responsibilities, equity, the impact of demographic inequity between sexes and genders will have any impact on their personal life, and ultimately being able to trust and respect each other on an equal playing field."
Female,No,"Hard to say, but based on the information given I'd say John needs to sit down and weigh up how much of an issue Rebecca's skin color is going to be with his family, and if he's still willing to go forward bearing that in mind. If it were me, the prospect of a serious long-term relationship would outweigh familial objections but I know different cultures have different emphasis on family ties. Without knowing how those variables weigh in I really couldn't give good advice: are we talking ""would make nasty comments whenever they came over"" or ""immediate disownment""? As to the Mark factor, frankly, I consider that to be a minor issue that can be dealt with if they are indeed true friends. ","Not an expert by any means, but I can say broadly that you would want to look at the romantic, communal, and practical. Romantic, of course, more or less speaks for itself. Loving each other and all that. Communal I use to mean how compatible they are in mindset , their views, values, etc. They don't have to be lockstep but they have to be sure that the similarities outweigh the differences. Practical of course refers to day-to-day stuff: can they have a living situation together? Are their impediments to them pursuing a long-term relationship? Can they be overcome? We could spend all night discussing the individual details but those off the top of my head are the 3 main 'groups' of things to think about."
Other,No,John shouldn't care what his family thinks unless it would put him in danger,Their own happiness with their partner
Male,No,A hypothetical situation does not give us an understanding of the people themselves and their full relationships in that situation.  There are too many different nuances and probabilities that could turn everything upside down.,"The enormous complexity of relationships can be solved in my ideal world by the ancient lemma: ""God gave you the gift of communication, use it. 
Although it's not a matter of faith, there's a good reason for that."
Male,No,"There is no absolute judgment in this situation. How one should think depends on how important the relationship with Mark is to John and how jealous Mark is, as well as how important the relationship with John's family is to him and how strict his family can be. If it seems that the situation could escalate to the point where the police might get involved, John should hesitate and may even have no choice but to refrain from pursuing Rebecca. If it doesn't reach that level, he can act more according to his feelings.

At the end of the day, no matter how much we discuss ideals, beautiful words, or logic here, if one finds themselves in such a difficult situation as a party involved or in a position close to it, they might not always be able to act effectively. Ultimately, it comes down to whether one has the courage to accept the possibility of something breaking in order to gain something else, and whether that possibility actually comes to fruition depends on luck.","There is no definitive list of things that people should consider when building romantic relationships, as what should be considered depends on each individual's situation. However, the very nature of love often makes it difficult to take these considerations into account."
Female,No,"John shouldn't care what others think of him and his choices... If he loves Rebecca he should not hold back and should tell her how he feels. Skin colour doesn't matter, everyone is created by God and all human beings are beautiful ❤️ What matters is what's in the heart rather than the exterior ","They should  : 
*Be committed 
*Be loyal
*Respect each other's choices 
*Be there for each other when they're going through a tough time.
*Have a job
*Be polite
*Taking turns in doing household chores
*Be supportive of their partner and stand up to them when family members/ friends/ relatives/ strangers say anything that makes them sad and devastated 

They shouldn't: 
*Be abusive ( verbally and physically) 
*Fat shame/ body shame 
*Alcoholic 
*Drug addict
*Leave when the female partner gets pregnant, they shouldn't also blame them.
*Be racist ( all races and cultures are beautiful )

Both the partners should think and consider whether their future child will get good education, health care and good mental health before deciding to have children 

I hope more people will stay in longer relationships and be with each other till their last breaths and wouldn't abandon their children "
