# Love and War

Shakespeare famously said that "all is fair in love and war". I was curious if this was a widely accepted notion among people, so I decided to collect a bit of data. To do this, I asked people what they thought very directly about Shakespeare's quote, and I also posed a complex relationship problem to the participants to ensure that there was genuine reflection being done. The full dataset is available in the file "Love_and_War.csv". 

The following questions were posed to participants:

* What is your gender?

_The following options were given for gender:_

* Shakespeare famously said, that "all is fair in love and war." Do you agree with this?

_The following options were given:_

| Yes | No | Maybe |

* Consider the following situation: John is attracted to a woman named Rebecca. John's friend Mark is also interested in Rebecca. Rebecca is extremely beautiful. If John were to begin a relationship with Rebecca, all of his friends would be envious of him including Mark who has strong feelings for her. There is another problem. John knows that his family would not approve of Rebecca because of her skin color. John is unsure of how to proceed. Rebecca has already indicated that she is attracted to him and if John would like to begin a relationship with her all he has to do is tell her how he feels. What are your thoughts on this situation? (Be as detailed as you like in your response.)

* What are some of the things that people should consider when pursuing a romantic relationship with someone else? (Be as detailed as you like in your response)
