# Trust vs Caution

A small sample of data was collected to understand the why some people may be trusting or cautious in their approach to interpersonal relationships.

The dataset is contained in the file 'Interpersonal Relationships Research 2.csv'

An ipython notebook that examines the spread of the data across across age, gender, etc. is available in the file 'Trust_vs_Caution.ipynb'

The relevant graphs are also stored as png images in this folder.

This dataset was originally a small sample of 99 participants, but additional data was collected to help identify potential trends. The final sample accounted for a total of 309 participants. In general, it should be noted that this sample size is still too small to draw definitive conclusions.

The participants were asked to answer the following questions?
* What is your Age?

### Here is a small excerpt of the data contained in the file "Interpersonal Relationships Research 2.csv"

| What is your Age? | What is your Gender? | With respect to interpersonal relationships, would you describe yourself as trusting or cautious? | Based on your previous answer, why do you think it is important to be trusting or cautious with respect to others? (Be as detailed as you like in your response) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 26-35 | Male | Trusting | I see that it is important to be a little of each, as healthy as possible, without excesses. I believe the key is to be careful until you know you can trust the person completely.|
| 18-25 | Female | Cautious | There are so many different motivations people have, and with them, many different opportunities for them to want to hurt others. It's safer just to avoid people who ask anything of you, just in case that leads to them taking advantage of you. |
| less than 18 | Male | Cautious | Personally I just have trouble trusting people, and think that caution is important in any relationship, it keeps you prepared for, if someone does something you have explicitly stated your against or when they display red flags. |
| 18-25 | Female | Trusting | Unless that other is my very close friend, I wouldn't be that trusting. Trust is very important in gaining relationships with others, no man is an island after all.. One way on another, a person is going to need help and they can't achieve that if they're too cautious |
| 36-50 | Female | Trusting | If you are always cautious and trust no one, then you will always be in the mind set of uneasiness, untrusting, and the worse feeling of all... alone. We may need alone time, but nobody truly wants to be alone. I have found with having trust in my partner, I am no longer alone and life is a lot easier, especially in raising the kids. Prior, there was no trust and a lot of abuse. |
| 26-35 | Other | Cautious | Because we live in a world where everything is perceived as survival of the fittest. Trusting others can be at a detriment to one's own health, especially when you factor in things like race and SO. |
| less than 18 | Prefer not to say | Trusting | I feel it's important to show trust so the other person feels more comfortable in whatever relationship you have with the person, and so you don't have any sort of tension that can ruin the relationship before it even really starts. But being cautious is just as understandable if you've been too trusting in past relationships. |
| 18-25 | Male | Cautious | Everyone is different. Some prefer quick decisive or even brutal honesty while others may be more akin to a lighter approach. At the end of the day it all depends on who is involved. Its important to be trusting for we truly only receive as much as we give in most respects, but being trusting to a fault is in itself a problem. Which is why a healthy blend of trust and caution is often required to service all parties involved the same respect and grace. Its important to exercise both sides to an extent for us to grow as people and hopefully grow our circle of trust alongside that. |

# General Discussion

Due to the relatively small size of the sample, the specfics of the data are not of great consequence and as such I think an informal discussion is more appropriate here. Many of the participants felt as though trust is important, as it allows a person to build a relationship much easier; on the other hand, many beleived that it is easy to get hurt in relationships and that consequently, caution is more advisable than trust when approaching relationships. The style of approach to relationships as it concerns caution and trust seemed to be relatively evenly split among the participants, with a small majority of 177 people describing themselves as cautious, while the remaining 132 people described themselves as trusting.

The graphs below show the relationship between trust, age and gender.

</div>

Across different age groups their is little to no significant variation between the choice of trust versus caution. Likewise, across genders, there does not seem to be any significant trends in the data. In fact, the most alarming feature of this dataset is how evenly split the participants choices seem to be alongside the strong opinions that people have presented in tandem with their views. It is important to note that this dataset is relatively small, but based on the information here, it's difficult to imagine a scenario where a persons approach (being more trusting or more cautious) does not in fact present a compatibility issue at the outset of relationship. Of course, the complexity of any psychological phenomenon makes it difficult to make definitive statements, but at the very least I think that the data here does give great precedent for further investigation.

It should be noted that many of the particpants spoke about the importance of being both trusting and cautious, and as such I beleive that an ordinal level of measurement featuring a spectrum across trust and caution would be much better suited for collecting information on this issue.

The following word cloud was generated from the responses the participants gave. The word frequency chart that illustrates the data itself is on the right. (The frequency graph is very detailed and will require enlargement to properly view.)

I have abstained from doing any real qualitative analysis of this data, as I personally feel as though the field is moving past most of the standard inferential statistics, toward machine learning and severe testing.

## Theoretical Frameworks

I think that it's important to briefly go over a few of the major theories and theoretical frameworks that are applicable to the issue of trust and caution. The list no doubt will extend far beyond the information discussed below, and this problem is one of the reasons why a data centric approach is so valuable; put simply, it provides what is possibly the only objective way to attempt an understanding of any given psychological phenomenon. Nonetheless, the work that has been done so far in the field still provides some direction as it concerns the framework for data collection. So I will briefly discuss a few of these ideas.

### Attachment Theory

Attachment Theory was first proposed by John Bowlby in the 1950s, and later developed by Mary Ainsworth in the 1970s. The theory was developed to explain the importance of early experiences with caregivers in shaping an individual's attachment style and subsequent approach to relationships in adulthood.

### Social Exchange Theory

Social Exchange Theory can be traced back to the work of George Homans in the 1950s and Peter Blau in the 1960s. They proposed that individuals engage in relationships that provide them with rewards that outweigh the costs, and that this concept can be applied to various social interactions, including romantic relationships.

### Cognitive Dissionace Theory
Cognitive Dissonance Theory was first proposed by Leon Festinger in the 1950s to explain the discomfort individuals experience when their beliefs and behaviors are inconsistent. The theory suggests that individuals may be more likely to trust others when they have committed to a belief or behavior that supports trust in order to reduce cognitive dissonance.

### Social Learning Theory
Social Learning Theory was developed by Albert Bandura in the 1970s and emphasizes the importance of learning through observation and imitation of others. According to this theory, individuals may be more likely to trust or be cautious based on the behaviors and attitudes they have observed in others.

### Self-Determination Theory
Self-Determination Theory was developed by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan in the 1980s and emphasizes the importance of meeting basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness in order to promote motivation and well-being. According to this theory, individuals may be more likely to trust others when their need for relatedness is met.

### Erik Erkison's Psychosocial Stages of Development
Erik Erikson's major theory is called the "Eight Stages of Psychosocial Development." It outlines a series of stages that individuals go through from birth to old age, each with its own unique psychosocial challenge or crisis that must be successfully resolved in order to move on to the next stage. These stages include trust versus mistrust, autonomy versus shame and doubt, initiative versus guilt, industry versus inferiority, identity versus role confusion, intimacy versus isolation, generativity versus stagnation, and ego integrity versus despair.
