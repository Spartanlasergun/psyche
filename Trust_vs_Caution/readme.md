# Trust vs Caution

A small sample of data was collected to understand the why some people may be trusting or cautious in their approach to interpersonal relationships.

The dataset is contained in the file 'Interpersonal Relationships Research 2.csv'

An ipython notebook that examines the spread of the data across across age, gender, etc. is available in the file 'Trust_vs_Caution.ipynb'

The relevant graphs are also stored as png images in this folder.

Two of the most relevant are provided below:

<div style="display: inline-block;">
  <img src="Age_vs_Trust_Level.png" alt="age vs trust" style="width: 46%; height: auto;">
  <img src="Gender_vs_Trust_Level.png" alt="gender vs trust" style="width: 46%; height: auto;">
</div>

Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn from the data, as the sample size is very small $(n = 99)$

However, there does appear to be some correlation with the age group of 18-25, that suggests that this particular age group is much more cautious than trusting. I intend collect a bit more data to verify this. A sample size of $n = 300$ should give better indications of possible trends.
