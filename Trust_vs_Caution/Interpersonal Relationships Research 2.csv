What is your Age?,What is your Gender?,"With respect to interpersonal relationships, would you describe yourself as trusting or cautious?","Based on your previous answer, why do you think it is important to be trusting or cautious with respect to others? (Be as detailed as you like in your response)"
18-25,Female,Cautious,My answer is in retrospect to my upbringing and the world we grew up in. Our world is a little rough to be too trusting.
18-25,Female,Cautious,Because it takes years I feel to truly trust someone and that no one stays in your life forever so you have to be ready to lose them at anytime.
26-35,Male,Trusting,"I see that it is important to be a little of each, as healthy as possible, without excesses.
I believe the key is to be careful until you know you can trust the person completely."
36-50,Male,Cautious,I've had too many disappointments
18-25,Other,Cautious,"I suppose when it comes down to it I'm cautious because I don't know what the other person is thinking. It doesn't mean that I'm not trusting of other people, but I don't want to overwhelm new people I meet. For people I've known for a while, I'm more likely to be honest with them as I've known them long enough to trust them with my inner thoughts (as out there as they can be at times). Basically, we're all just going through life and I just want to make sure I'm nice and polite with everyone I meet"
36-50,Male,Cautious,because nowadays you can't have a blind trust !!
26-35,Female,Trusting,I tend to trust people because I tend to surround myself with people I believe I can trust. I would rather trust and occasionally have my trust broken than to never feel close to people because I have a hard time trusting them.

less than 18,Male,Cautious,If you always be trusting then just one little lie can upset your life that's why you need to be cautious with other people
less than 18,Male,Trusting,"If you know someone well enough, you should be able to count on them and know that they won't go around screaming about something you told them at the top of their lungs.(I didn't really know how to respond to this, so sorry if my answer makes no sense.)"
18-25,Female,Cautious,"Honestly, Think just depends on how the person was raised. For an example, im more cautions around others due to being raised by two narcissistic people. My fiance in the other hand he was raised in loving household and he tends to be more trusting with others. "
18-25,Male,Cautious,"It's important to be cautions, because if you would trust everybody, you can get in really big trobles, like loosing important information, and getting abused or even have risk for your life. And some persons sometimes behind the mask of humanity brings danger. "
18-25,Female,Cautious,"There are so many different motivations people have, and with them, many different opportunities for them to want to hurt others. It's safer just to avoid people who ask anything of you, just in case that leads to them taking advantage of you."
36-50,Male,Trusting,"Caution is valuable. I tend to trust more at first as I've witnessed too many good people get sidelined because of a perceived abnormality. So, I get to know people as I would anyone. Sometimes it backfires and that's stressful. But most of the time, you find a lot of redemption and opportunity in people. "
36-50,Female,Trusting,"I’ve never considered the importance of the matter. I am equally naive and aware of the dangers of having trust in partners of interpersonal relationships. Yet it is in my nature, and also my desire to do so. I’ve been hurt as many times as I’ve been loved and would never change."
26-35,Male,Cautious,"Pienso que es más preferible ser cauteloso pues uno no puede saber quién o cuál es la intensión de las personas con los que uno debe estar en la página,siempre hay que aclarar las intenciones y el objetivo de todo lo que unos sube o comparte en las redes."
18-25,Female,Trusting,"Well, trust necessarily contains cautions.  But caution doesn't necessarily contain trust.  Based on the current situation of the world,  we have to be cautious alongside be trustworthy to gain peace of mind,  ultimate happiness. "
less than 18,Male,Trusting,"I love meeting new people and making friends, i usually do what they want instead of what I want so we get to know more, i wanna make them trust in me so I can be more helpful when they're in need, basically I want them to know that i'm a trust worthy friend that will always be on their side"
less than 18,Male,Trusting,So if I can trust someone that I can rely on then I don't have to worry about the person that would betray me even if that person wouldn't 
26-35,Female,Trusting,Trust is the foundation of the best relationships so I believe in trust.
less than 18,Female,Cautious,You don't want to fall into something and get in trouble so being cautious is a good thing but it is also important to be trusting as well he just have to have the right balance of both it is important to make mature choices about these things but it is always good to be cautious.
less than 18,Female,Cautious,"I believe it’s important to be cautious with who you build a relationship with. Some people could do anything to get to know you and your person or life just for the sole purpose of using your experiences against you, or to harm you, even if that weren’t the case, there are many scenarios were people reveal their true colors when put in a certain situation, I don’t believe it’s ok to watch someone’s every move and second guess or push people away just because you’re afraid of getting hurt but I do strongly believe to be cautious about those around you and when trusting someone "
26-35,Female,Trusting,"I am actually both. At first glance as a stranger I am very respectful but I was also raised in a family of feminists who believed in equal treatment based on ability and behavior, not gender. Because of this I will remain respectful to someone until they give me a reason not to be. I have always firmly believed respect is earned, not given and if I show you respect I expect the same treatment. Treat me poorly, don't expect the ""nice girl"" to stay so nice. And I've had people think being 'nice to them meant I was stupid or gullible and have tried to scam me. They learned real fast this ain't no bunny they were dealing with, it was a fox raised by wolves. In other words, my family is fierce when disrespected, I'm much more subtle but just as troublesome. But i digress, I am usually trusting with respect, often giving it freely but once one of my red flags is raised, I am much more weary and start to pay attention to see if they truly deserve my respect"
26-35,Male,Cautious,Try to see the good in people and respect their opinions it’s ok to disagree 
26-35,Male,Cautious,"I have a very rough past when dealing with people in general. Art helps me cope and it was used against me growing up from people i loved and trusted. I was denied going to art school my entire life because i wasnt good enough. I i have gone to school for everything under the sun. I was a nurse and didnt like it, i went to school for marine biology and didnt like it like i thought i did growing up. My parents denied me anything that gave me joy art was the big one, so i stopped drawing.. i stopped everything artistic. Felt like for a time i wasnt allowed to like it or do it. I felt like it wasnt a gift i was allowed to have. Amd my artwork suffered tremendously. Recently i was given a diagnosis of being anxious and having severe depression and art was given to me as a coping skill. Drawing out everytine i wanted to hurt myself or was feeling emotions strongly to help release it in a positive way. So tjats when i began tattooing on myself, and i fell back in love and i started drawing on paper again, i find art in almost everything i do and i havent been this happy in a long time when i pick up that pencil and start a piece or hold that tattoo gun in my hand... i feel joy like no other. Joy that i was denied my whole life and i feel like i finally belong and found what i am supposed to do and should have done my whole life. Art has saved my life on more then one occassion and it gives me the strength to continue and do amazing. I am learning some new techniques and skills that i wasnt taught growing up and i am learning to finally be myself"
26-35,Male,Cautious,Cautious since i do make sure if my art is stolen by anyone else.
18-25,Male,Cautious,"Life always have ways to throw you random curvballs. Fake friends definatly are one of them. I have spent a lot of time on the internet and a lot of that time is with people who made me think they enjoyed me for who I was, rather was just an attempt to get closer to me so that they could get free shit from me. 

When picking up a friendly relationship. I try to play my cards right, While being trusting is a good way to build a really strong bond, Too much trust can be a bad thing, because no random someone you never seen face to face is going to fall over for you in a time in need.
"

18-25,Prefer not to say,Cautious,"Actually, I'm trusting. When I first look at something. It is more pleasant to live, trusting passers-by.  Glad to have spoken to you.  Someone needs you. But we are all adults. People need more than emotions. "

18-25,Male,Cautious,"It is very extremely important to be cautious and trusting with respect to others because we may/may not know who the people or the person could be when we meet them in person or online and observe about how they treat us first with respect or no respect. If a person have treated us with respect, we should treat them back with respect and earn their trust with caution of what we speak in common."
26-35,Female,Trusting,I don't think it's my principal position. I just am that way because of my good experience with people. I'm being lucky.

36-50,Male,Trusting,"For my part, caution is the duty of every person, but I always trust people, because I often deal with the right people by virtue of experience, so my dealings with trust may be better, so that I can be treated the same"
18-25,Female,Cautious,"If you aren't cautious with giving respect, people will expect it from you and only take advantage. Personally, I only have respect for those I believe deserve it and aren't going to turn around and use it against me. "
26-35,Female,Cautious,Be Cautious with others as trusting people has always led me to troubles and facing stressful situations in life. I no longer trust people the way I used to and it has definitely helped me to better protect myself from a physical and emotional aspect.
18-25,Female,Cautious,"trust without proper discernment is a path to self destruction. some people will use trust as leverage to take advantage of others, and are not worth the risk of suffering over. "
26-35,Female,Trusting,"Because we can’t live or survive alone by own self, so we have to trust each other to live happily together."

26-35,Male,Trusting,the way i look it ...i try to be trusting because i think i would like to give people a chance who ever they are ....like a benefit of doubt ...but once a trust is broken .... its hard to restore. but mostly am trusting .... with a little bit of caution.
less than 18,Male,Cautious,"Personally I just have trouble trusting people, and think that caution is important in any relationship, it keeps you prepared for, if someone does something you have explicitly stated your against or when they display red flags. "
26-35,Male,Trusting,"People accuse me of being very naive, but I basically assume that someone else doesn't mean me any harm. I always believe in others."
18-25,Female,Cautious,"People are not always what they seem at first glance. They may have ulterior motives, which can sometimes be very detrimental to my psychological health. I prefer to observe a person for a long time before trusting him."
18-25,Male,Cautious,"I think it’s better to be cautious, especially in the world we live in today as it seems like everyone has a secret motive that they exploit others for."
18-25,Male,Cautious,Being cautious prevents alot of mental breakdowns situations and make you pay more attention to everything around you in order to see what's good for you and what's not 
18-25,Female,Trusting,"Unless that other is my very close friend, I wouldn't be that trusting. Trust is very important in gaining relationships with others, no man is an island after all.. One way on another, a person is going to need help and they can't achieve that if they're too cautious"
less than 18,Female,Cautious,"Cause not everyone is always the same, there some people that hide of how they act in front of you and its better if people are aware of what is good and what is bad. Cause if people being to trusting there a chance the person get backstabs or being drags into something that was bad.
But being to much cautious can bring negatif impact of trusting your friends and sometimes it can make you lose your friends, but sometimes is good to be aware of what is good and bad. And if being aware of what people do is wrong, it have a chance to help other to know what is good or bad.
There a positif and negatif of being cautious, but it depens of how people see it."

It is how people should be treated anyway"
36-50,Female,Trusting,"If you are always cautious and trust no one, then you will always be in the mind set of uneasiness, untrusting, and the worse feeling of all... alone. We may need alone time, but nobody truly wants to be alone. I have found with having trust in my partner, I am no longer alone and life is a lot easier, especially in raising the kids. Prior, there was no trust and a lot of abuse. "
18-25,Male,Cautious,"It's better to be cautious.
The reason is we never know what's inside people's heart and their true intentions. Sometimes they look good outside, but inside their heart there's something bad they gonna do to us.

It's like ""don't judge book by its cover"". That's why being cautious is important.

Me myself ever almost get scammed 2 times when I'm open commission. Now, I already taking very cautious measure to any strangers that ordered my commission.
On real life though, I'm introvert and very silent to any strangers. However, I'm still care to those I know."
18-25,Female,Cautious,"Due to my experience, I will and would always choose to be cautious, even if we know the person from months, I rather wait longer. "
18-25,Male,Cautious,"honestly I'm a bit of both but the reason why i chose ""Cautious"" is because the day and age we live in everyone has their own agenda, has a overwhelming level Narcissism, behave in such unbelievably insensitive/rube way. some use it as a shield from the world or some just mimic the behavior to fit in, then there are some that act like sheep and just go where the herding dogs bark. It's because of al that and a little more that i find it hard to trust people even though i want too."
18-25,Male,Trusting,"Of course being fully trusting has its downsides, but in my opinion being more trusting than cautious is better as you give yourself more opportunities in life that way. ""Benefit of the doubt"" and ""innocent until proven guilty"" are statements that i stand by. "

36-50,Female,Cautious,"actually i'm inbetween both trusting and cautious, trust is important to become friends and cautious is just in case they're not really saying things what they mean or something or maybe me saying wrong things? i don't know...i find it hard to understand people and people often misunderstand... "

50 and above,Male,Trusting,"I am probably a little too trusting, but I think one has to give people a chance. Not recklessly trusting - especially on-line, but hear folks out before you judge them. Might be greatfully surprised more often than not."
less than 18,Female,Cautious,"Caution is something you gain over experience in your environment. Its simply a way to prevent bad things from occurring; in an age where scams are normal, being a trustful person is ignorant. However that doesn't mean to never be vulnerable. Trust is something that come slow and overtime. You put these initial barriers up to keep the people with bad intentions out. "
26-35,Other,Cautious,"Because we live in a world where everything is perceived as survival of the fittest. Trusting others can be at a detriment to one's own health, especially when you factor in things like race and SO."
less than 18,Female,Trusting,Trusting is something important to me and I don't want to loose it
less than 18,Prefer not to say,Trusting,"I feel it's important to show trust so the other person feels more comfortable in whatever relationship you have with the person, and so you don't have any sort of tension that can ruin the relationship before it even really starts. But being cautious is just as understandable if you've been too trusting in past relationships."
36-50,Female,Cautious,"I guess, for me it is the personal fear to get used and / or abused, if that makes any sense. "
18-25,Male,Trusting,"Everyone has reasonable motives to turn on you, however it is healthy to assume they will not even if you feel like they might."
18-25,Male,Cautious,"Because you don't know who is out there and more countries like mine Colombia

36-50,Female,Trusting,It is impossible to build strong relationships without trust.
18-25,Male,Trusting,"Trusting is good because people are naturally good, if you refuse to trust anyone you’ll never build meaningful relationships "
less than 18,Female,Trusting,"I think it’s worth trusting the person in whom you are 100% sure, and you need to be careful with those in whom you are a little, but in doubt"
26-35,Male,Cautious,"It's important to be cautious around others because we can't always trust people to act honestly or fairly.
"
18-25,Male,Cautious,"Everyone is different. Some prefer quick decisive or even brutal honesty while others may be more akin to a lighter approach. At the end of the day it all depends on who is involved. Its important to be trusting for we truly only receive as much as we give in most respects, but being trusting to a fault is in itself a problem. Which is why a healthy blend of trust and caution is often required to service all parties involved the same respect and grace. Its important to exercise both sides to an extent for us to grow as people and hopefully grow our circle of trust alongside that. "
