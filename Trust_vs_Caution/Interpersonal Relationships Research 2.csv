What is your Age?,What is your Gender?,"With respect to interpersonal relationships, would you describe yourself as trusting or cautious?","Based on your previous answer, why do you think it is important to be trusting or cautious with respect to others? (Be as detailed as you like in your response)"
18-25,Female,Cautious,My answer is in retrospect to my upbringing and the world we grew up in. Our world is a little rough to be too trusting.
18-25,Female,Cautious,Because it takes years I feel to truly trust someone and that no one stays in your life forever so you have to be ready to lose them at anytime.
26-35,Male,Trusting,"I see that it is important to be a little of each, as healthy as possible, without excesses.
I believe the key is to be careful until you know you can trust the person completely."
36-50,Male,Cautious,I've had too many disappointments
18-25,Other,Cautious,"I suppose when it comes down to it I'm cautious because I don't know what the other person is thinking. It doesn't mean that I'm not trusting of other people, but I don't want to overwhelm new people I meet. For people I've known for a while, I'm more likely to be honest with them as I've known them long enough to trust them with my inner thoughts (as out there as they can be at times). Basically, we're all just going through life and I just want to make sure I'm nice and polite with everyone I meet"
36-50,Male,Cautious,because nowadays you can't have a blind trust !!
26-35,Female,Trusting,I tend to trust people because I tend to surround myself with people I believe I can trust. I would rather trust and occasionally have my trust broken than to never feel close to people because I have a hard time trusting them.
less than 18,Prefer not to say,Trusting,So You Can Always Be Trusted Cause Its Hard Get Trust
less than 18,Male,Cautious,If you always be trusting then just one little lie can upset your life that's why you need to be cautious with other people
less than 18,Male,Trusting,"If you know someone well enough, you should be able to count on them and know that they won't go around screaming about something you told them at the top of their lungs.(I didn't really know how to respond to this, so sorry if my answer makes no sense.)"
18-25,Female,Cautious,"Honestly, Think just depends on how the person was raised. For an example, im more cautions around others due to being raised by two narcissistic people. My fiance in the other hand he was raised in loving household and he tends to be more trusting with others. "
18-25,Male,Cautious,"It's important to be cautions, because if you would trust everybody, you can get in really big trobles, like loosing important information, and getting abused or even have risk for your life. And some persons sometimes behind the mask of humanity brings danger. "
18-25,Female,Cautious,"There are so many different motivations people have, and with them, many different opportunities for them to want to hurt others. It's safer just to avoid people who ask anything of you, just in case that leads to them taking advantage of you."
36-50,Male,Trusting,"Caution is valuable. I tend to trust more at first as I've witnessed too many good people get sidelined because of a perceived abnormality. So, I get to know people as I would anyone. Sometimes it backfires and that's stressful. But most of the time, you find a lot of redemption and opportunity in people. "
36-50,Female,Trusting,"I’ve never considered the importance of the matter. I am equally naive and aware of the dangers of having trust in partners of interpersonal relationships. Yet it is in my nature, and also my desire to do so. I’ve been hurt as many times as I’ve been loved and would never change."
26-35,Male,Cautious,"Pienso que es más preferible ser cauteloso pues uno no puede saber quién o cuál es la intensión de las personas con los que uno debe estar en la página,siempre hay que aclarar las intenciones y el objetivo de todo lo que unos sube o comparte en las redes."
18-25,Female,Trusting,"Well, trust necessarily contains cautions.  But caution doesn't necessarily contain trust.  Based on the current situation of the world,  we have to be cautious alongside be trustworthy to gain peace of mind,  ultimate happiness. "
less than 18,Male,Trusting,"I love meeting new people and making friends, i usually do what they want instead of what I want so we get to know more, i wanna make them trust in me so I can be more helpful when they're in need, basically I want them to know that i'm a trust worthy friend that will always be on their side"
less than 18,Male,Trusting,So if I can trust someone that I can rely on then I don't have to worry about the person that would betray me even if that person wouldn't 
26-35,Female,Trusting,Trust is the foundation of the best relationships so I believe in trust.
less than 18,Female,Cautious,You don't want to fall into something and get in trouble so being cautious is a good thing but it is also important to be trusting as well he just have to have the right balance of both it is important to make mature choices about these things but it is always good to be cautious.
less than 18,Female,Cautious,"I believe it’s important to be cautious with who you build a relationship with. Some people could do anything to get to know you and your person or life just for the sole purpose of using your experiences against you, or to harm you, even if that weren’t the case, there are many scenarios were people reveal their true colors when put in a certain situation, I don’t believe it’s ok to watch someone’s every move and second guess or push people away just because you’re afraid of getting hurt but I do strongly believe to be cautious about those around you and when trusting someone "
26-35,Female,Trusting,"I am actually both. At first glance as a stranger I am very respectful but I was also raised in a family of feminists who believed in equal treatment based on ability and behavior, not gender. Because of this I will remain respectful to someone until they give me a reason not to be. I have always firmly believed respect is earned, not given and if I show you respect I expect the same treatment. Treat me poorly, don't expect the ""nice girl"" to stay so nice. And I've had people think being 'nice to them meant I was stupid or gullible and have tried to scam me. They learned real fast this ain't no bunny they were dealing with, it was a fox raised by wolves. In other words, my family is fierce when disrespected, I'm much more subtle but just as troublesome. But i digress, I am usually trusting with respect, often giving it freely but once one of my red flags is raised, I am much more weary and start to pay attention to see if they truly deserve my respect"
26-35,Male,Cautious,Try to see the good in people and respect their opinions it’s ok to disagree 
26-35,Male,Cautious,"I have a very rough past when dealing with people in general. Art helps me cope and it was used against me growing up from people i loved and trusted. I was denied going to art school my entire life because i wasnt good enough. I i have gone to school for everything under the sun. I was a nurse and didnt like it, i went to school for marine biology and didnt like it like i thought i did growing up. My parents denied me anything that gave me joy art was the big one, so i stopped drawing.. i stopped everything artistic. Felt like for a time i wasnt allowed to like it or do it. I felt like it wasnt a gift i was allowed to have. Amd my artwork suffered tremendously. Recently i was given a diagnosis of being anxious and having severe depression and art was given to me as a coping skill. Drawing out everytine i wanted to hurt myself or was feeling emotions strongly to help release it in a positive way. So tjats when i began tattooing on myself, and i fell back in love and i started drawing on paper again, i find art in almost everything i do and i havent been this happy in a long time when i pick up that pencil and start a piece or hold that tattoo gun in my hand... i feel joy like no other. Joy that i was denied my whole life and i feel like i finally belong and found what i am supposed to do and should have done my whole life. Art has saved my life on more then one occassion and it gives me the strength to continue and do amazing. I am learning some new techniques and skills that i wasnt taught growing up and i am learning to finally be myself"
26-35,Male,Cautious,Cautious since i do make sure if my art is stolen by anyone else.
18-25,Male,Cautious,"Life always have ways to throw you random curvballs. Fake friends definatly are one of them. I have spent a lot of time on the internet and a lot of that time is with people who made me think they enjoyed me for who I was, rather was just an attempt to get closer to me so that they could get free shit from me. 

When picking up a friendly relationship. I try to play my cards right, While being trusting is a good way to build a really strong bond, Too much trust can be a bad thing, because no random someone you never seen face to face is going to fall over for you in a time in need.
"
18-25,Male,Cautious,The people that hurt you always be closer to you 
18-25,Male,Trusting,"For better intrapersonal relationships
"
18-25,Prefer not to say,Cautious,"Actually, I'm trusting. When I first look at something. It is more pleasant to live, trusting passers-by.  Glad to have spoken to you.  Someone needs you. But we are all adults. People need more than emotions. "
18-25,Prefer not to say,Trusting,Because we must avoid closing ourselves off to new opportunities to meet people and because I believe that being more trusting can make us more charismatic in front of others.
26-35,Male,Trusting,trust is an important key to successful relationships
18-25,Male,Trusting,If there is no trust people cannot rely on eachother 
18-25,Prefer not to say,Cautious,"People love to take advantage of everything in a row, that's why you should be cautious"
36-50,Prefer not to say,Cautious,Everybody has a secret world deep down. 
18-25,Male,Cautious,"It is very extremely important to be cautious and trusting with respect to others because we may/may not know who the people or the person could be when we meet them in person or online and observe about how they treat us first with respect or no respect. If a person have treated us with respect, we should treat them back with respect and earn their trust with caution of what we speak in common."
26-35,Female,Trusting,I don't think it's my principal position. I just am that way because of my good experience with people. I'm being lucky. 
18-25,Other,Cautious,"it,s better to be cautious to save yourself and others from mental and physical harm "
26-35,Prefer not to say,Cautious,I think it's important to be cautious because being too trusting can result in being taken advantage of or winding up in a bad situation.
less than 18,Male,Trusting,"In my opinion, I think if you trust with respect in interpersonal relationships, your relation with others can grow, and you can connect more with said relationship."
26-35,Prefer not to say,Cautious,"I'd always cautious just in case of hackers, thieves and who knows what else?"
26-35,Male,Trusting,well i dont really know ! 
less than 18,Male,Cautious,"Damn, ahh.
Well, like, I don’t know, I’m 13 soon 14 and I never thought about it ..
Hmm"
18-25,Male,Trusting,"I personally feel like trusting in others because understanding them and their opinions, feelings and motivations is important; I would most likely have a bit of a hard time opening up to others, but I'm willing to respect them in whatever way they see fit."
36-50,Male,Trusting,"For my part, caution is the duty of every person, but I always trust people, because I often deal with the right people by virtue of experience, so my dealings with trust may be better, so that I can be treated the same"
18-25,Female,Cautious,"If you aren't cautious with giving respect, people will expect it from you and only take advantage. Personally, I only have respect for those I believe deserve it and aren't going to turn around and use it against me. "
26-35,Female,Cautious,Be Cautious with others as trusting people has always led me to troubles and facing stressful situations in life. I no longer trust people the way I used to and it has definitely helped me to better protect myself from a physical and emotional aspect.
18-25,Female,Cautious,"trust without proper discernment is a path to self destruction. some people will use trust as leverage to take advantage of others, and are not worth the risk of suffering over. "
26-35,Female,Trusting,"Because we can’t live or survive alone by own self, so we have to trust each other to live happily together."
less than 18,Male,Cautious,Bueno nunca sabes cómo son las demás personas 
26-35,Male,Trusting,the way i look it ...i try to be trusting because i think i would like to give people a chance who ever they are ....like a benefit of doubt ...but once a trust is broken .... its hard to restore. but mostly am trusting .... with a little bit of caution.
less than 18,Male,Cautious,"Personally I just have trouble trusting people, and think that caution is important in any relationship, it keeps you prepared for, if someone does something you have explicitly stated your against or when they display red flags. "
26-35,Male,Trusting,"People accuse me of being very naive, but I basically assume that someone else doesn't mean me any harm. I always believe in others."
18-25,Female,Cautious,"People are not always what they seem at first glance. They may have ulterior motives, which can sometimes be very detrimental to my psychological health. I prefer to observe a person for a long time before trusting him."
18-25,Male,Cautious,"I think it’s better to be cautious, especially in the world we live in today as it seems like everyone has a secret motive that they exploit others for."
18-25,Male,Cautious,Being cautious prevents alot of mental breakdowns situations and make you pay more attention to everything around you in order to see what's good for you and what's not 
18-25,Female,Trusting,"Unless that other is my very close friend, I wouldn't be that trusting. Trust is very important in gaining relationships with others, no man is an island after all.. One way on another, a person is going to need help and they can't achieve that if they're too cautious"
less than 18,Female,Cautious,"Cause not everyone is always the same, there some people that hide of how they act in front of you and its better if people are aware of what is good and what is bad. Cause if people being to trusting there a chance the person get backstabs or being drags into something that was bad.
But being to much cautious can bring negatif impact of trusting your friends and sometimes it can make you lose your friends, but sometimes is good to be aware of what is good and bad. And if being aware of what people do is wrong, it have a chance to help other to know what is good or bad.
There a positif and negatif of being cautious, but it depens of how people see it."
26-35,Male,Cautious,Being cautious in relationships can help protect your emotional well-being and prevent you from getting hurt. Take time to get to know the person and establish trust before fully committing.
18-25,Male,Cautious,"I don't really trust the person I don't know, but I will try to understand him how he is, even though I can open my heart to talk to him."
36-50,Male,Trusting,Be trusting makes others confident and willing to be open and honest with you. 
less than 18,Male,Trusting,"It’s not only the right thing to do but  
It is how people should be treated anyway"
36-50,Female,Trusting,"If you are always cautious and trust no one, then you will always be in the mind set of uneasiness, untrusting, and the worse feeling of all... alone. We may need alone time, but nobody truly wants to be alone. I have found with having trust in my partner, I am no longer alone and life is a lot easier, especially in raising the kids. Prior, there was no trust and a lot of abuse. "
18-25,Male,Cautious,"It's better to be cautious.
The reason is we never know what's inside people's heart and their true intentions. Sometimes they look good outside, but inside their heart there's something bad they gonna do to us.

It's like ""don't judge book by its cover"". That's why being cautious is important.

Me myself ever almost get scammed 2 times when I'm open commission. Now, I already taking very cautious measure to any strangers that ordered my commission.
On real life though, I'm introvert and very silent to any strangers. However, I'm still care to those I know."
18-25,Female,Cautious,"Due to my experience, I will and would always choose to be cautious, even if we know the person from months, I rather wait longer. "
18-25,Male,Cautious,"honestly I'm a bit of both but the reason why i chose ""Cautious"" is because the day and age we live in everyone has their own agenda, has a overwhelming level Narcissism, behave in such unbelievably insensitive/rube way. some use it as a shield from the world or some just mimic the behavior to fit in, then there are some that act like sheep and just go where the herding dogs bark. It's because of al that and a little more that i find it hard to trust people even though i want too."
18-25,Male,Trusting,"Of course being fully trusting has its downsides, but in my opinion being more trusting than cautious is better as you give yourself more opportunities in life that way. ""Benefit of the doubt"" and ""innocent until proven guilty"" are statements that i stand by. "
50 and above,Male,Trusting,it is probably stupid t be trusting but i do it anyway
18-25,Male,Trusting,I think trusting people builds better interpersonal relationships than paranoia 
26-35,Male,Cautious,Staying cautious with who let in to your life is  a strong self preservation tactic. If you trust the wrong person they can dismantle your entire life and all you've worked for.
36-50,Female,Cautious,"actually i'm inbetween both trusting and cautious, trust is important to become friends and cautious is just in case they're not really saying things what they mean or something or maybe me saying wrong things? i don't know...i find it hard to understand people and people often misunderstand... "
18-25,Male,Cautious,"At the end of the day, the world favours the cautious, even if it doesnt seem like it it still is kill or be killed"
36-50,Male,Trusting,Trusting others is about mutual respect. The cynic may never be let down but will also struggle to experience happiness. You need to let down the guard to truly be with someone.
18-25,Other,Cautious,Cautiously trusting. People tend to lie but not everyone does. 
less than 18,Female,Cautious,"Well, not all people would be telling the truth even if you was friends."
26-35,Male,Cautious,"I am a regularly good person, but I have a very high sensitivity when I appreciate people who can become ""toxic"" and improve over time, but however everyone would have to be careful to be a very important person to me because I would be watching sickly for their well-being."
26-35,Prefer not to say,Cautious,It's good to be cautious to a random person who approach to you
36-50,Male,Trusting,I belive that be a trusting person is a easy way to have healthy relationships.
less than 18,Female,Trusting,Because everyone deserves kindness in life no matter how mean that person was to you.
26-35,Male,Trusting,Some of them depend on me
26-35,Male,Trusting,"Respect is based in self reflection, and both depends, respect for others like for self"
18-25,Male,Trusting,I love to be kind to folks. I love to help out and be a nice guy. It makes me feel great as a person. That is why I'm filling in this survey.
50 and above,Male,Trusting,I don't know if it's important or even  wise. It's just my nature.
less than 18,Female,Trusting,Because it is friendly. 
50 and above,Male,Trusting,"I am probably a little too trusting, but I think one has to give people a chance. Not recklessly trusting - especially on-line, but hear folks out before you judge them. Might be greatfully surprised more often than not."
less than 18,Female,Cautious,"Caution is something you gain over experience in your environment. Its simply a way to prevent bad things from occurring; in an age where scams are normal, being a trustful person is ignorant. However that doesn't mean to never be vulnerable. Trust is something that come slow and overtime. You put these initial barriers up to keep the people with bad intentions out. "
26-35,Other,Cautious,"Because we live in a world where everything is perceived as survival of the fittest. Trusting others can be at a detriment to one's own health, especially when you factor in things like race and SO."
less than 18,Female,Trusting,Trusting is something important to me and I don't want to loose it
less than 18,Prefer not to say,Trusting,"I feel it's important to show trust so the other person feels more comfortable in whatever relationship you have with the person, and so you don't have any sort of tension that can ruin the relationship before it even really starts. But being cautious is just as understandable if you've been too trusting in past relationships."
36-50,Female,Cautious,"I guess, for me it is the personal fear to get used and / or abused, if that makes any sense. "
18-25,Male,Trusting,"Everyone has reasonable motives to turn on you, however it is healthy to assume they will not even if you feel like they might."
18-25,Male,Cautious,"Because you don't know who is out there and more countries like mine Colombia 
"
50 and above,Male,Cautious,"I live in Brazil, where trust has been a rare commodity, historically speaking. And I have lived for long enough to know that trust is something that is earned over time, and not something that is granted out of whim. "
18-25,Prefer not to say,Cautious,"In interpersonal relationships, you should always be cautious, you never know exactly what the reaction or behavior of another may be. Trust is something that should come in the process of forming a relationship."
36-50,Female,Trusting,It is impossible to build strong relationships without trust.
18-25,Male,Trusting,"Trusting is good because people are naturally good, if you refuse to trust anyone you’ll never build meaningful relationships "
less than 18,Female,Trusting,"I think it’s worth trusting the person in whom you are 100% sure, and you need to be careful with those in whom you are a little, but in doubt"
26-35,Male,Cautious,"It's important to be cautious around others because we can't always trust people to act honestly or fairly.
"
18-25,Male,Cautious,"Everyone is different. Some prefer quick decisive or even brutal honesty while others may be more akin to a lighter approach. At the end of the day it all depends on who is involved. Its important to be trusting for we truly only receive as much as we give in most respects, but being trusting to a fault is in itself a problem. Which is why a healthy blend of trust and caution is often required to service all parties involved the same respect and grace. Its important to exercise both sides to an extent for us to grow as people and hopefully grow our circle of trust alongside that. "
26-35,Male,Cautious,"So I think it’s important to remember that when someone tells you something they are either being dishonest or describing their actual worldview, neither of which may be true. I never assign mal-intent immediately but unless I know someone I recognize it’s a possibility. I also recognize that someone could feel they’re being honest but not actually telling you the truth, so it’s important to remain objective."
36-50,Female,Trusting,without trust you'll never be able to develop any relationship. If you can't trust those who are close to you who can you trust?
36-50,Female,Cautious,"Unfortunately, there are a lot of cases when the trust went ""sideways"" to the artist."
18-25,Other,Cautious,"An abundance of trust may lead to exploitation, but caution can be eased over time."
26-35,Male,Cautious,Experience
18-25,Female,Cautious,"Personally, I feel like respecting and believing people easily would leave you vulnerable to those people abusing the fact that you trust and respect them so easily. An example off the top of my head would be something like drama that recently happened to a man named ""Kwite"" where someone came out against them with allegations of rape and people were starting to hate on Kwite for it. But they never supported their claim with clear proof and just said words, this is normal on the internet. And when Kwite addressed these allegations, he absolutely destroyed them with 100% true screenshots and explaining everything, even showing how Kwite's accuser was instead trying those things on Kwite, not the other way around. Then when this person saw that Kwite came with a good comeback, then changed their story, the internet now understanding that Kwite didn't commit such an act, they started to rally against the accuser, to which they ended up leaving the internet all because Kwite stopped talking to them. Kwite's reputation was almost completely ruined because of this, he almost lost his job because people blindly believed the accuser since well, its the internet. As well this hurts actual victims because this entire drama was fake, which makes actual victims not want to come forward about serious stuff like this."
18-25,Female,Cautious,Because for every good apple there's 20 rotten ones waiting for any opportunity to spoil you too. 
less than 18,Female,Cautious,"I would want to be careful because there are many things that could happen if not taken slowly as possible. Being most respectful to others is something to be caution with, for it would be something that might make a person feel differently about what they take part in."
less than 18,Female,Trusting,I feel that if everyone has trust in each other then relationships can be built stronger.
36-50,Male,Trusting,To establish good relationship
18-25,Male,Trusting,I think that it is important to be trusting to others because it helps to build relationships.
18-25,Female,Trusting,It's love
less than 18,Prefer not to say,Cautious,"I have met a lot of people that want my respect but in turn treat me like garbage or as if I'm expendable. I refuse to be treated as lower than others and I have grown tired of being a figurative door mat. If you want my respect and trust you will earn it. In other words; you respect me and treat me kindly like a decent human being, I will treat you kindly and respect you."
less than 18,Female,Cautious,"I have to be careful when I upload something, because if I post something carelessly I feel like I'm offending someone"
less than 18,Other,Cautious,"it is important to be cautious especially in this cruel world we live in. now a days, you cant trust everything a person says. so in relationships, being a little weary  is a lot better than being 100% trusting. "
18-25,Female,Cautious,"I believe that it is the situation that makes a person be careful, since many Internet users, hiding behind anonymity, can steal the identity of another person, his personal data, portfolio with complete impunity. Of course, you should not completely close yourself off from the world, but you need to filter with great sensitivity and accuracy who you communicate and interact with, because, as usual, not friendly people like to pretend to be someone else to rub into trust."
26-35,Male,Cautious,I think it depends on how well I know the person
26-35,Female,Cautious,"It's always good to be cautious because we only know someone's appearance, not their true intentions. Sometimes, it takes two or three years of getting to know someone to discover their true nature. Some people act really well to conceal their despicable personality"
18-25,Male,Cautious,I think you need to be a bit of both. You need to have trust that your relationship is trusting both ways and not just one. But you need to also be a bit cautious as not everyone is looking out for your best interests.
18-25,Prefer not to say,Trusting,I don't know. Maybe the world could just use some more trust. More openness. 
18-25,Male,Cautious,Cautious
less than 18,Male,Trusting,"For me personally, It's important to trust eachother to build a better communication and relationship with the individuals. "
36-50,Male,Trusting,"I feel it is important to be trusting of others, because in most cases looking out for each other works as a benefit for ones' personal survival. Also, from my personal experiences, people are upfront, or at least become upfront with you, when they see you are in need of it.  "
18-25,Male,Trusting,It is important
26-35,Prefer not to say,Cautious,Because scammers take on all shapes and sizes.
18-25,Female,Cautious,"It is important to Not Be too Trusting if you become too trusting you might get hurt by it,If you become Cautious you prevent being attached to the wrong things and Beings careful of signs of red flags with people to prevent the chances of something toxic or bad overall, as we don't always know what we are up against"
50 and above,Male,Cautious,"Well, we are all self centered people. We tend to backstab each other if we believe it would serve us. But one can go to far into cautious or to far into trusting. It ultimately is a choice. "
26-35,Female,Cautious,"I consider it important to be cautious to avoid emotional damage that can come from other people or even from oneself, or even unconsciously harm others. Think things through in advance to avoid even serious mistakes."
36-50,Male,Cautious,"Poor prior experiences with previous interpersonal, especially romantic, relationships."
less than 18,Female,Trusting,"It is good to be trusting because you want to have someone you can tell a lot of things to, especially if you have a mental health problem or anything. I still think everyone should be cautious with who they trust and what they are trusting that person with. I know that because I have learnt with a lot of my friends that they can keep some types of secrets and others they can't. It is almost like a guessing game. :) Have a good day!"
26-35,Male,Cautious,"I don't think I explicitly think it's important, I think I instinctively feel that way."
26-35,Male,Cautious,Because I deal with people I know very well
18-25,Other,Trusting,"You don’t want to judge people right off the bat, everyone deserves an equal chance to either being your friend or your foe. Typically as the phrase goes, “strangers are just friends you haven’t met yet”."
26-35,Male,Trusting,Dating 
18-25,Female,Cautious,Cautious as its never bad to be safe! :)
less than 18,Male,Trusting,I think it's because trust makes us feel safe around someone because we know they won't hurt on purpose
less than 18,Prefer not to say,Cautious,Cautious
18-25,Female,Cautious,"I think it's important to be cautious around people, especially ones that I don't know because I cannot accurately predict how this person will make decisions and handle situations. That does not mean that I am distrustful. I am cautious around people, but I will eventually be trusting if I've known them long enough."
26-35,Male,Cautious,Life experience has taught me hard lessons. Many people will seize an opportunity to exploit kindness and perceived weakness

less than 18,Male,Cautious,"Selon moi, il est important de réfléchir avant de donner sa confiance aux autres, donner sa confiance trop facilement c'est comme donner de quoi nous détruire à une personne. Cela dit, être trop prudent c'est aussi passer à côté de possible opportunités de construire une relation saine. Pour résumer : Il faut être un minimum prudent mais encore une fois : le danger est dans la dose, devenir froid et distant avec tout le monde n'est pas bon non plus. "

18-25,Male,Trusting,"Knowing what the world's like (and possibly because of my upbringing), the people who you're building a relationship of any sort with, have a respect for honesty and sincerity given that your intention is to know them better. 

I feel that being trusting can help with both maintaining and building relationships of any kind. However we're human and being cautious can still be a good thing especially for people you don't know at all from the start. 

In other words, I feel that being trusting is more important with regards to interpersonal relationships, but we can never be too sure about the other person's true intentions unless you test them."

18-25,Female,Cautious,People are scary and I don't trust them
18-25,Female,Trusting,"Well I'd reckon you wouldn't have very solid interpersonal relationships if their wasn't a good foundation of trust. Trust is a two way street and if you don't trust the other person, the odds are they won't trust you either. Or the relationship would be unbalanced and the other person offended by the lack of trust, and then things would probably sour from there. Your relationships would fall apart or be strained, I think, and I could see how that'd make being trusting important. "

18-25,Male,Cautious,"As a person with little to no trust in people, I think trust is still an important thing to give in life, However, I barely trust nowadays anymore because of my past mistakes and actions, and also because of other peoples actions.

18-25,Female,Cautious,"I used to be a trusting person but I've been hurt by quite a lot of people in the past which I thought were friends, I cut the contact with them, and now I'm as happy as I can be. :) Being all by myself was a great decision, of course I stayed friends with the ones who didn't lie and used me for their benefits though!

18-25,Female,Trusting,"I believe that trust, doesn't necessarily comes from being gullible or naïve, at the worst and not properly grown it is. But once you grow with the understanding of the human nature and the deep craving that we need for social connections. The understanding that being trusting, doesn't only mean to close our eyes and let things happen to us. But to be open to love others and trusting our ability to take yourself out when it's time, and to trust our abilities to handle an situations.

26-35,Female,Trusting,"It is important to find a balance between being trusting and cautious with respect to others because both qualities have their own advantages and potential pitfalls.

Trusting:
Encourages open communication: Trusting others can foster an environment where people feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings, leading to stronger relationships and better collaboration.
Builds positive relationships: Trust is a cornerstone of strong relationships, both personal and professional. Demonstrating trust can create a supportive and nurturing atmosphere.
Enhances teamwork: When team members trust one another, they are more likely to work effectively together and achieve common goals.
However, being overly trusting can also have downsides:

Risk of being taken advantage of: If you trust others too easily, you may become vulnerable to manipulation or deceit.
Misplaced trust: Trusting the wrong person can lead to disappointment, betrayal, or even harm.
Cautious:
Reduces the risk of harm: Being cautious can help protect you from potential harm, such as scams, fraud, or abusive relationships.
Promotes discernment: Cautious individuals are more likely to critically evaluate information and people, leading to more informed decisions.
Encourages self-reliance: When you're cautious, you're more likely to rely on your own instincts and capabilities, fostering personal growth and independence.
However, being overly cautious can have its drawbacks as well:

Strained relationships: An excessive level of caution can lead to suspicion and make it difficult to establish or maintain strong relationships.
Missed opportunities: Being too cautious may result in missed opportunities for personal or professional growth, as you may be hesitant to take calculated risks.
Slows decision-making: Excessive caution can lead to overthinking and indecision, which can hinder progress."

26-35,Female,Cautious,I think it is important to mantain a cautious aproach at least at the beginning of a relationship. It is not that i am not trusting but i think that trust must be earned
26-35,Male,Trusting,"I trust people and I am sometimes let down. It's life and it's okay. To trust someone, and for them to trust me, means we have an opportunity to grow. Trusting someone is an invitation for honesty and really there are very few non-negotiable problems.

Some people, myself included, really need a person to open up to. Sometimes it feels like nobody listens or they give advice that isn't actionable so an open ear is like a nucleation site of thoughts and ideas. 

To be vulnerable is scary. To put yourself out there and not know the outcome is scary. To express a preference is scary. If I did these things I might fail yes, but I might also succeed and reap its benefits. Regardless of the outcome i will be stronger and the next time will be easier.

Like when humans were hunter-gatherers, EVERYBODY had to look for food, make shelter, etc. When we discovered farming some people could farm, and some people could make pots or invent math. We could grow because we could trust that someone else had our backs

36-50,Male,Trusting,"There is no right answer. On one hand being trusting is good you build connections and it's something that we as humans thrive to have because we wanna be a part of something. Simultaneously caution is important because there are people out there who would take advantage of you. I think trust is important because we need to be able to have faith not only in each other but in ourselves. I think that when people believe there's only bad in the world that's when you give way to being bad yourself because you just figure ""Hey if everybody's doing it why should I even bother?"" it's the defeatist cynic mentality."

18-25,Female,Trusting,Maybe trusting i guess O.O
18-25,Female,Cautious,"I would usually be trusting, but over the years it’s hard to trust more and more people. It’s good to be nice to people, just be cautious with who you meet."
36-50,Male,Trusting,you need to be both
18-25,Male,Trusting,"I feel like being trusting helps the person feel like you respect and understand them, and always believe them."
18-25,Male,Cautious,"Sometimes i have days where i prefer working alone, but when i'm doing a game, i'd ask someone to do the coding, because i'm best working as a graphic designer."
18-25,Female,Cautious,Idk 
36-50,Other,Cautious,"I am a cautious person, because the events that we live in this world encourage us to be cautious.  Because of my naivety, I do what is necessary to step back and examine all the evidence before giving my confidence and to avoid that I run into my loss."
18-25,Male,Trusting,"You can trust people if they treat you well, and that's why I trust people, because they are kind to me."
18-25,Male,Cautious,"In all my relationships, except with my sister, I am cautious since it isn't uncommon for any form of trust to be used against me in a moment of vulnerability. It isn't wrong to trust others, but one also needs to be careful not to be too open with people you don't know well or who have hurt you in the past."
26-35,Male,Cautious,At a young age one becomes to comfortable and trusting with their environment at an older age one becomes wary and cautious because a lot of things happen at this age where the mind becomes very progressive and needy
18-25,Female,Trusting,"It's important to be trusting so please can count on you 

"
36-50,Female,Trusting,"I believe people wants to be good and want bring it out of them. Still I know that anyone could act on false beliefs or make a mistake, so being trusting doesn't mean being not a bit cautious."
18-25,Prefer not to say,Cautious,"I think that meeting people must always be careful.The more work these days, most of them are online jobs that don't really meet, so you have to be careful that you will be easily deceived."
18-25,Prefer not to say,Trusting,"Generally i think people have good intentions, i might feel uncomfortable sharing very personal info but if its a small favor to ask and it doesn't put either party in danger, I'm all up for it. Most people really care about themselves or in other words are self-centered, they wouldn't spend time harming others when they have to get their own lives together. As shallow as this may sound but first impressions and looks are important when it comes to trust, the halo effect of attractiveness is very real, otherwise there wouldn't be studies on it worldwide. So yes, i trust most people but still am cautious based on first impressions."
36-50,Male,Trusting,"Right, in my opinion, in a relationship, there has to be trust on both parties, that is, without trust, there is no relationship, there is distrust and the relationship does not last long."
less than 18,Male,Trusting,"We need to believe we can be nice and if is all fake or a lie, we should no trust anymore... "
36-50,Male,Trusting,"because it's only way to happiness. You can't be full and happy if you can't have closeness with someone alive (of your level of development, that's why 40 cats don't make you happy, any animal can't. Unless you are on their level). So, for deep relationsip, for fullness of life we have only people (spirits, maybe too, but still human forms of life). I am sure, that cautiousness is erotical fantasy - it's some kind of hypocritisy, like, I am so tender prinsess, and I wait for a kind prince who would who would tame me like a squirrel. For me it's lie and self-lie. I understand reasonable emotional self-defence, but no one wants to deal with all these infantil underdeveloped in emotional area beings. "
26-35,Male,Cautious,"I had to realize that I am too naive when it comes to interpersonal relationships and therefore constantly fall for the same types of people who then manage to exploit me (emotionally). Therefore, I feel it is important to be distrustful and I strive for appropriate distrust in this regard."
50 and above,Male,Trusting,so che a volte si sbaglia ma io parto sempre con la fiducia nel prossimo non sono cauto ma se una persona tradisce la mia fiducia la cancello dalla mia vita
less than 18,Male,Cautious,cautious 
less than 18,Prefer not to say,Cautious,"While being cautious is a good idea to prevent potential damage, being trusting is just as important and there should be a good balance between the two. I've noticed that if you shut down completely when others talk to you in fear of getting hurt, you won't make any friends whatsoever. There is a level of vulnerability that must be shared regardless when communicating with others. One must accept that they aren't perfect and will always be prone to rude comments or even bullying, simply due to the fact that they are in the same room as someone else in the first place. While it's extremely effective to drive people away, that is not always for the best, as interpersonal relationships are very important to mental wellbeing.
This is coming from someone that was pretty much selectively mute for 8 (and a half?) years. It has seriously taken a toll on my emotions and the way I control them because it is natural to be silent. Coming out of that, I found that it's okay to be yourself, and you just need to be the bigger person if anyone challenges that.
I apologize if this was too elaborative or sounded like word vomit. I had a lot of thoughts to get down, and not enough time to edit or revise as I would like."
26-35,Other,Cautious,I have a personal history of mental illness (schizophrenia) as well as being transgender--I don't feel like I can risk being easily trusting of others because of this. I have had many potential relationships be impacted because of preconceived notions and thus am cautious to any potential new social relationship. 
26-35,Prefer not to say,Cautious,"This may be one of those many things can change depending on circumstances, life history, or even mood. The answer above isn't the response 100% of the time. However, it can be a bias one way or another depending on contributing factor mentioned above. People in general will surprise you more often than not. So, as with anything you encounter that can be unpredictable, it may be best to exercise caution until you have a better understanding."
36-50,Male,Trusting,"I think I'm both ""Trusting"" and ""Cautious"", but it I have to choose, I choose ""Trusting"".
Because without trust, you're all on your own. So at some point you have to trust others."
less than 18,Female,Trusting,"Usually, at least from personal experience, people who tell extremely personal stuff about their past is true. I know there’s a chance that some people will lie about their personal life for attention or just because of whatever reasons. However if there is a small chance that they are telling the truth you should be respectful and trust that they are telling the truth. It’s very damaging to ANYONE of any age to be told that they’re a lier. God forbid that they’re a kid talking about something troubling and you call them a lier, but even if it’s someone from a “normal” background or has a pretty stable background, you should still treat them with as much respect as you would anyone else. I hope I answered this right-! And if not then sorry qwq."
less than 18,Female,Trusting,Being trustworthy means people feel safe around you.
