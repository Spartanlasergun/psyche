I was not aware that one of his friends had seen  me dancing with another man in the club and had called him and rold him., I was not really flirting but did like the company . Nothing happened with this guy at rhe end of the night i left and went home. When I opened the front door to our apartment, he was waiting for me, however, on the way home I had stopped at a seven eleven to buy him, his favorite snacks and soft drinks. He immediately accused me of being inconsiderate of his feelings and even daring to arrive home later then agreed time. I was merely defending myself from his horrible words,he swore me and called me all sorts of horrid names. I moved into our kitchen to get away from him, I did not feel safe, he followed me and this crazy person, grabbed me by my hair, I screamed and shoved him away from me. He slapped me through my face so hard, that i hit the floor and then he jumped on the side of my head, I was scared, hurt and dazed. I begged him to stop but he didn't. He slapped me again kicked me  until i screamed for help, he then stopped and left me there. I crawled to our guest bedroom and lay on the floor bruised and Hurt, I was so angry and felt so helpless that I smashed the hi fi system we had in this bedroom ,he came in and knelt beside me and ordered me to come to bed, I had no choice,he had locked the front door,  he then ordered me to hold him which I did and told me I was his....that was the night I knew I had to get away and thank God I did eventually.

And that only the refusal of the church representative to come to where the deceased wanted to be buried shouldn't result in Party A's inconvenience and financial loss.\n",
      "Party B wasn't happy with that, and talked about how such things were important, using cultural and emotional arguments.\n",
      "It then came to Party A's attention that, contrary to what they had been informed of prior to the argument, the reason for those two being held on separate occasions, was not only because of the church representative's refusal but also because the friends of the deceased would have difficulties arriving, as they themselves were of a high age as well.\n",
      "As such, Party A accepted that it would be reasonable to attend both occasions, under the consideration of the deceased party's memories and probably also according to what they would have wished for.\n",

      "During my high school years, I was bullied by my classmates. I belonged to a group of outcasts. I did not attend sections, did not know what I wanted to do in life, did not know who I was in the world. Therefore, I had a clear task to find my meaning in life. I chose the search for the meaning of life as a theme for a project during my school years. The project had to be defended in order to receive a certificate. I tried myself in different new areas, I was an instructor in a video game, preparing a group of 12 people for international competitions. I used to write poetry, I wrote short stories. When I analyzed my short life path, told about it in my project, the teacher did not understand me and ridiculed all my achievements. The teacher ridiculed everything that made me happy, which allowed me to overcome the complexes of communication with people and finally recognize the natural qualities of a leader in myself, without hiding them or abandoning them. I then burst into tears and missed several lessons of mathematics, closing myself in the toilet room. This teacher never apologized for the situation, not understanding why I was so offended and upset.\n",

      "Be that as it may, the opinion of a person who does not understand the issue is clearly not worth listening to so as not to be upset, because he does not know how much work it took to literally create a personality in himself anew after everything that could traumatize me as a person, in childhood. Even if this teacher does not like my assessment project, I believe that this work motivated me to understand myself, become better and understand who I am. If not for that job, I would not have been a better coach for my dear student, who also had bad experiences with other coaches in the past. I became an exemplary coach for a student from the playing team, who did not criticize for mistakes and helped to master what seemed incredible and incomprehensible, which I am proud of to this day.\n",

      "This was back when I was about 6 years old and my Dad had just met my mother, who had 2 daughters of her own already. Before I met her and my sisters I was an only child and I didn't take change well and I had a hard time adjusting to new people. I was eager to make new friends, yes, but i didn't like the idea of a new mother, and i thought she would take my dad from me. (though my bio mom died when i was 2, i was very attached to my dad) I wish to come clean though, I was a bad kid. I was very stubborn about letting her come into my life because i thought my life was fine.(and i had already gone through this sort of thing before her) I was rather rude and harsh towards her despite her only showing me care and love. i also didn't get along with her daughters. One day her older daughter (name will not be told) and i got into a really bad argument, and i mean bad. Though I can't remember what it was over, I do remember threatening her, eventually it turned into her chasing me through their house with a metal ice cream scooper, when i hid behind a gate that barricaded the island in the kitchen (which was built so there dogs couldn't get to the front door) when i locked the gate, she flailed the scooper in her hand over the gate and it slipped out of her hand. It hit me in the head, and i just stood there in shock. When their mom came out of her room to check, she yelled. She sat me up on the kitchen counter and was panicking, I remember being so calm about the whole thing as she panicked, sitting there and telling her i was fine. she rushed me to the emergency room and i had to get stitches.\n",
      "I never got the hint though, it took me until after 4 years or so of them being together to realize that my life wasn't perfect, and that my dad wasn't happy. I realized that that woman... actually cared about me, which hurt me to realize how long i was wrong about her, and though it took me a little longer to call her my mother, I remember the day of their wedding when i cried, i had finally realized that I had a mother, someone besides my dad to give me comfort when he wasn't around, someone who i could tell my sorrows and pain to. I still fight with her now, but I know it's because she sees potential in me, and that she cares about me. And that older sister who hit me with the spoon? they're now my best friend and my biggest fan. my older sister gave me what i needed, that i had lost from my brother; an older sibling to tell me that im doing good, and i can be whoever i want if i try. i cherish them for that...\n",

      "I procrasti-called my good friend, we were both working. He answered, I felt happy because I was receiving reinforcing signals within my body to remain connected with others and especially my chosen family/tribe. We discussed: work, next appointment deets, shared some random disconnected pieces of knowledge just for fun, our impressions of some music and both agreed to leave it there until next time.\n",

      "One experience I remember was when I was 19. I finally came out of my shell expressing myself and finally felt happy with myself. Then after posting a picture of me on social media I get a bang on my door from my father and he destroyed every last bit of confidence I had. I won’t go in detail what he said or what followed next but I am currently on medications for ptsd anxiety and major depression. \n",

      "I accompanied a friend of mine to one of the most hip and well known supper clubs in our city. It was a grand gevening, everyone was dressed in their finest and we got to meet various local celebrities, it was so amazing, one of the lady celebs we met was simply amazing and quite humble and down 2 earth.  We ended up partying the night away together but all the champagne made me pass out and I woke up the next day bit hungover at my friend's place but truly happy at the amazing event we attended.\n",

      "Relatively recently, a situation occurred in my life when my best friend, with whom we had known each other for 5 years, betrayed me. When we were 13-15 years old, we were good friends. Later, due to mental health problems, she began to use drugs, alcohol, and smoke. It was difficult enough to finish school years at the same time and do everything possible to help fight addictions, promising a good future and support, no matter what happens. She later lied about being hit by a car. For three days I was worried about her life, realizing that a coma was quite possible (She had an eating disorder and heart problems), I was looking for at least one mention in the news about a hit girl in her city, then in the region. And only three days later I was able to contact my relatives, who said that this was a lie, but everything was fine with her. A few months later she wrote to me again saying she was bored and would like to talk. But two weeks later she poured a lot of bad words on me, cursing me and saying that I am the cause of all her troubles in life, that I am the person who almost ruined her, despite all attempts to help earlier and make her happy. I tried to write to her, despite the blocking in social networks, I tried to apologize if I did something wrong. And I would never have thought that drugs can turn 2 months into 3 years (When we last talked, she wrote 8 years from the date of our acquaintance, but it should have been 5 years). I believe that while we are alive, we can change everything if we quarreled with someone. Maybe now it’s hard for me, it hurts, I feel injustice towards me, but if she is happier this way, then I agree to let the person go. If one day she needs my help, I will be ready to help her, because I promised that I would always be by her side, no matter what happens. This is very important to know for people with mental disorders. Now I'm trying to get better by doing a lot of work in the field that I love - in drawing.\n",

      "One instance of conflict is with one of my friends on the subject with religion. Despite us both being Christian, I was answering questions he had about my own religion since he was looking for a new church denomination to be a part of. After some exchanges, I received a difficult email where he ridiculed my religion in a large 2-page rant and ended it with an ingenuine \"enjoy your day\". I knew that at this time my emotions were quite tender, so I wrote down on paper my whole emotional feeling on the matter. Then after a day or two, I wrote a new email in response, honestly hoping that he would be able to find the church he was looking for and wishing him well on his journey. I felt that this was the best way to respond. It was a response that I would be happy to tell Christ \"yes, that is what I said\". \n",

      "Not sure if this counts as it's connected to a conflict, but at the time when my mother was leaving my father, my sister and I were at her side supporting her, which was an incredibly vulnerable time for us. It's a happy memory despite the circumstances. / If this doesn't count I can mention how a friend helped me out by giving me a home for a year, it was a wonderful experience as we've always had a lot of deep conversations together, and the support was really needed back then. \n",

      "I am an adult, I work in a state research center, and I face the world of work. A world that I live with these injustices, these non-recognition, these perversions. At the time I was a senior technician with over ten years of experience. And like any research team, a young engineer took the lead. At the start it is going well, good atmosphere of good relations, I realized that it was not going to last. The team leader regularly spoke up when I was asked a technical question and asked to answer. After which, other events will intervene, and I will see that it will not work out for my career. My advancement, my possibilities of taking on responsibilities will disappear in favor of him. His ambition was such that he ended up changing jobs and becoming head of the laboratory. One day during a retirement party for a former colleague, we met. A little surprised by his presence, he was distant with shifty gaze, he was at the back of the room and I was on the opposite side. After the traditional speeches, I made the decision to go greet him, to see his reaction and make him feel uncomfortable. It was nothing to us. We were going to talk like two adults who had things to talk about. At one point, he interrupted me and told me that he wanted to tell me his deepest thought. It is there, that He asked me to forgive him for all his harmful actions made to harm my career and put to his profit. Frankly surprised by this confession, I told him that I was happy that he became aware of these errors and that I forgave him. For my part, I was already retired, so no more contact with him, but I admit that it freed me, to know that this was a real fact, and not linked to my perception of the facts.\n",
