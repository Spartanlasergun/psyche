"No conflicts in recent memory - I am pretty easy-going and try to talk out concerns.  No fights, verbal or physical, and no real issues.  Closest thing I can come up with is deciding to leave a Government job after I found out the previous year's effort had been wasted due to miscommunication and/or not being given critical information.  No anger, just disappointment.","Sold an old sports car to someone from out of town where they did not test-drive the car.  Just loaded it on a trailer and drove home 4 hours.  I was honest, but there can always be conflicts of different expectations.  Happily, the buyer was very pleased with the car and has contacted me several times since."
"Due to the differences in values, my parents always want to impose the experience and thoughts of their generation on me, and then they will cause disharmonious quarrels, such as money, opinions on the meaning of life, and social interaction. After that, I gave up and avoided too much communication with them for a long time.This is the problem of the past and the problem of the present. I have been trying to prove my point of view through actions in recent years to change their thinking.","When I spent my school life, I met the 3D industry, which brought meaning to my life and was undoubtedly a great surprise. In the past, I always struggled with the level of painting. After combining with computer art, many of my ideas and ideas in the past can be realized. There is nothing special. I think this is the biggest turning point in my life."
When I was in Mumbai for a short trip I fought with my family over where to eat out.,I agreed with my friends over the fact that our Student Council was terrible!
"A few days ago I had a conflict. I was finishing dinner and my parents were also having dinner. I finished eating and I wanted to answer a message to my partner in chat because he was feeling bad. My parents at that time began to question my use of the cell phone, saying that I used it a lot. Previously it was in my grandmother's house and I used it to draw. Drawing on the cell phone, it is easy and practical.But I have a visual problem since birth so I always wear glasses. They scolded me about my answers, I wanted to help my partner or girlfriend, I told them that I draw a lot to improve and be a good artist, practice until exhaustion to be great. But my mom answered me ""so if I wasn't good at drawing, I should stop."" For me, drawing is everything, but what he said hurt me. And I left that place, I wanted to sleep or cry in my room but they stopped me. I insisted on leaving but the only thing that happened was that I hit myself on the head and screamed, I hurt myself and said hurtful things to myself. it was a shock.That didn't happen unless I was drunk.","I do not know what to choose. But before that my brother gave me a tablet for my birthday to draw on my monitor. I felt vulnerable, as if I received a lot of support, but I didn't know how to use it. I felt like Van Gogh and his brother. It's funny I always tell that and at the end I say that I will be recognized when I die. But I do not think so."
"As a scholar and practitioner of holistic self-awareness, I use the valuable empirical and psychological tool called the Enneagram. My sister is an 8 and she would rather be right than have a family. I am a 7 and I love her very much for being older than me and having participated in my childhood as a very powerful female reference. I am currently 51 years old and she is 64. I have gone through a spiritual awakening to the point that I have the gift of healing at Pachita levels, as Jacobo Grinberg explains, but without blood. The thing is that 11 days ago we had a strong discussion by audio message on Whatsapp in which I told her everything I think of her from love but shouting a lot. I was very relieved but she does not interpret or understand anything I say to her, believing that my mind is disturbed because she only spoke to her of Love and acceptance.",I have accepted that my 89-year-old mother has taken 4 doses of a global pharmaceutical experiment to try to change human DNA and that in the process she eliminates part of the useless human beings according to an elite that controls us and I embraced her with all my love that a son can give to a woman who agreed with me to come to this dimensional plane called earth to have the roles of mother and son. The embrace of love and acceptance comforted us and incidentally I healed her spine because I saw a strange flash in her aura.

"Am the last of 4 kids, 3 men and a lady. Our matriarch passed away a few years ago and according to our culture everything that belonged to our mother is passed on to the last born, being me. One of the things she left us was a lucrative rental property and since she passed I never benefited from it at all, my immediate brother took everything over and was the one getting the financial windfall. Fate would have it that he had to go to the USA permanently and so he had to leave the management to me. But he schemed with my sister and pulled the rug from under my feet and the management of the property went to my sister. My issue was‚Ä¶ no one bothered to let me know. I had never expressed the intention of getting anything that belonged to our mum, my view was always ‚Äúeverything belongs to everyone ‚Äú, and I felt betrayed and hurt. I would have gladly handed over the management of the property to my sister without any reservations. If we were to stand before society and the law I would win hands down but I won‚Äôt fight for something that was meant for family and family doesn‚Äôt consist of one person.","I was previously single, living in a block of flats that also had families in it. Kids loved me and I love kids too‚Ä¶ their simplicity and honesty is quite refreshing. But their parents liking me was another story. So one day this kid stops me and says hi, I say hi back and she says ‚Äúmy mum told me not to say hi to you but you‚Äôre my friend, this is what I‚Äôll do.. I‚Äôll say hi the run away before Mum sees me ‚Äú.
It touched my heart. If you don‚Äôt like me, kindly don‚Äôt involve the child in your hate, she‚Äôs innocent. We‚Äôve always clashed with that neighbor till the present."

Varies from whatever past experiences I went through some are really really stupid others let's just say I learned from them the hard way ,"Being a idiot/ass of myself and screwing with people who can give me a quote ""run for my money"" with or without me realizing it"
"I was in a past abusive relationship, today I reflect back on it and wonder what on earth I thought, but indeed I'm amused,at how we as humans think we can change people into whom we want them to be or how we would like them to behave.. I went out clubbing on my own and came home a bit later than usual. I was not aware that one of his friends had seen  me dancing with another man in the club and had called him and rold him., I was not really flirting but did like the company . Nothing happened with this guy at rhe end of the night i left and went home. When I opened the front door to our apartment, he was waiting for me, however, on the way home I had stopped at a seven eleven to buy him, his favorite snacks and soft drinks. He immediately accused me of being inconsiderate of his feelings and even daring to arrive home later then agreed time. I was merely defending myself from his horrible words,he swore me and called me all sorts of horrid names. I moved into our kitchen to get away from him, I did not feel safe, he followed me and this crazy person, grabbed me by my hair, I screamed and shoved him away from me. He slapped me through my face so hard, that i hit the floor and then he jumped on the side of my head, I was scared, hurt and dazed. I begged him to stop but he didn't. He slapped me again kicked me  until i screamed for help, he then stopped and left me there. I crawled to our guest bedroom and lay on the floor bruised and Hurt, I was so angry and felt so helpless that I smashed the hi fi system we had in this bedroom ,he came in and knelt beside me and ordered me to come to bed, I had no choice,he had locked the front door,  he then ordered me to hold him which I did and told me I was his....that was the night I knew I had to get away and thank God I did eventually. I am now happy and free.","I accompanied a friend of mine to one of the most hip and well known supper clubs in our city. It was a grand gevening, everyone was dressed in their finest and we got to meet various local celebrities, it was so amazing, one of the lady celebs we met was simply amazing and quite humble and down 2 earth.  We ended up partying the night away together but all the champagne made me pass out and I woke up the next day bit hungover at my friend's place but truly happy at the amazing event we attended."
I‚Äôm sensitive it‚Äôs hard to be around people even though I love them üòç ,Wen I saw üëÄ my wife in the club I was like fuck my life ima do whatever she wants 
"i was once ridiculed by my parents for my hobbies, the hobbies basically had nothing to do with going outside","i once would go every easter with my family and other family to a nature swamp park, it was really nice, but we stopped doing it since my family was more far away from the park than my cousins, meaning every time we would sleep really late after visiting the park"
"Back then, I used to fight with my parents.","Back in the days when I was a little girl, I dream of being the most talented artist in the world."
I had a small conflict with my friend the gravity of the matter was that he wanted to leave art and craft for a new hobby of cycling ,I had no conflicts with my mother while having conversation 
"I had a rather nasty disagreement with my brother when our parents passed away,   He did not disclose to me some financial arrangements he had with our mother before she passed.  I discovered he was taking advantage of her and had been doing so for years.  My brother was far more our mother‚Äôs favorite and much more a mama‚Äôs boy than I was, I was the agressive, problem child and never let our mother dominate me, he did.  Hence my brother and I haven‚Äôt spoken in over ten years.   I developed a much more dominant personality than my brother did.","So many experiences to choose from, hard to pick just one, but I think I have one.  I was traveling to see a friend run in a cross country meet at a small college in upstate ny.  The meet was in the morning and the trip was about 3 hours and I was traveling alone.  Part of the drive took me along a beautiful stretch of interstate through a valley in the Catskill mountains.  I made this trip very early  and saw the sun rise over the peaks.  I had the entire interstate to myself it seemed,  and I felt as if I were so at peace with my surroundings and one with nature.  The trip back was not quite the same, there was traffic and the sun was already up. "
"Regarding art, I would say that I have always been ashamed to show my drawings to my family, because years ago they used to make fun of me, and although I was never a little sad I never showed them to them, and I kept drawing, to date I have shown them to only a few people in my family, but not to those who said about my drawings","I remember that in high school the teacher old us to draw something, I don't remember what it was in particular But I drew a person, there are many people who don't feel ashamed to show their drawings, but I didn't show them to anyone, so I remember that a boy I liked saw my drawing and said That he drew well, it was nice to hear that, a shame that boy will end up disappointing me"
"The last conflict I‚Äôve had with a friend is one where one friend suddenly turned on the other. I don‚Äôt know if it was a fit of rage, but it came out of nowhere. I stuck to the friend not in said fit of rage, and calmed down the other. I don‚Äôt know how the two stand at the moment and I do not know how this will effect my relationship with them in the future.",A group of five adults buying out a top row of a movie theater just to watch Super Pets.

"Hello. I really want to help you even though I'm confused as to how this might be connected. Long story short my family fell apart because of years of abuse from my father who eventually raped my sister and threatened to kill me, as well as attacked my mother twice. We solved the situation by running away from him, but I'm still trying to recover and my family as well as my health is basically in shambles. ","Not sure if this counts as it's connected to a conflict, but at the time when my mother was leaving my father, my sister and I were at her side supporting her, which was an incredibly vulnerable time for us. It's a happy memory despite the circumstances. / If this doesn't count I can mention how a friend helped me out by giving me a home for a year, it was a wonderful experience as we've always had a lot of deep conversations together, and the support was really needed back then. 
I hope this helps and that your research goes well. Best of luck."
I had to live with my aunt for about three months. She was very abusive and only cares about herself. In her eyes we could never do anything right and mistreated her.,Pretty much everyday with my mom and my sister. The three of us are a loving family who usually don't get into conflict with each other. We do sometimes but not very often.
nothing ever happend to me or my friends/family other than my friend having a eating disorder,nothing really
"I became a monk of the Oldest Parents and was told by someone I love and care for very much that I am not a monk. The Oldest Parents accept me as a monk and son, I expect anyone I would be a family with, would respect them and myself, especially the effort of being a monk.","Gaining the approval of our Creator. I was added to his family by him, as are all of his descendants, it seems I have moments of that and pieces of it, that remain not in conflict."
well I got a knife thrown at me by my grandmother Idk if that counts it was the only major fight ever in my family it was more in a fit of temper rather than violence tho so we worked it out :),Well I've had lots of great times with my family and friends. I'm too young to date tho so no SO for me lol. I've had a few sleepovers with my best friends in the world I'm also writing a book with them spending time with them like this is one of my fav experiences so I'll put that here. gl with your research :)
"dont remember much, but it was from when i wasnt the nicest of kids back in 8th grade, i got a lecture from my mother that set me straight for the remaining time of my year","an awkward experience where i peeped in one someone watching something at a gyms computer, he kindly warned me not to do that"
"whenever I was 3 or 4 (cannot remember exactly) my mother and father got divorced and when I was 5 father got re-married to a female named ""Gwen"" Gwen's really nice! Then mom got re-married when I was around.. 7-ish? Anyways- Father is for around half of the year down in Florida or up in Connecticut for rainfair.. He claims it's for the money but I think otherwise and that it's because I did something wrong to hurt him/our relationship with each other or something in that area..","Whenever I got with my current gf, it is pretty nice! We've known each other for a while now at least a year or two but we got together late-mid 2022. It's a wonderful bond/relationship with her and between each other and I hope it doesn't stop!! PS: Hope these are good and help you with you research!"
"Cold war between my sister and I, we used to be there for each other, care for each other until one day that all changed love turned into hatred, we argued so much that we were willing to hurt each other, ","Our father went into a terrible accident which caused our mother grief and my sister and i came together, ending years worth of rivalery"
I am frequently at odds with most of my family members(mostly over varying opinions) the last with my youngest brother over his LARP group ,Although not frequently enough I find it peaceful and relaxing to go fishing with my father last time I caught my first fish in 20+ years 
I've had a conflict with a friend mainly because of trust issues/betrayal,Every time I had a good time with family or friends.
I grew up with religious parents and when I told them that I no longer felt I believed in there religion. (I felt this way after I had had suicidal thoughts and smiling depression and I felt there was nothing or no one that was helping me and I felt alone.) After I told them however they told me I could continue following their practice or be shipped off to a private school that taught that religion.  ,"My friend once got me a compass. While it might not seem like much I had told my friend about a compass my parents got me that had religious text engraved into it. I said that is made me really hurt me for reasons I didn't understand. After telling this to my friend they got me a beautiful compass that had my favorite poem engraved in it. They said that they knew it meant a great deal to me and that they didn't want me to worry about the compass from my parents anymore. This touched me in such a way I can't really explain. To this day I couldn't tell you why the compass my parents got me brought me such grief, but I can tell you that the grief vanished at that at of kindness that I will never forget."
" I argued with my father recently because he asked me to do things that I find to be unrealistic and unnecessary, as a lot of children think of the tasks that their parents require of them. He was supposed to have provided a reward for said tasks and then did not..  It's a very one-sided system and it frustrates me because his motto is: ""he who has the gold makes the rules"" and that may be so... but I think fairness is also very important.. and when fairness is not enforced or respected it opens the door for future interactions to be tyrannical unfair and one sided...

*We live on opposite sides of the country and the task was something simple like answer questions thoroughly...
I answered the questions yet I didn't get him to do whatever it was he promised in a timely manner. which affected my ability to do something that was important to me. 

",I had recently broken my cell phone and needed a bridge loan to get a new one and my father stepped in and just gave me the money instantly without question and I really appreciated it. 
It was on the year 2021 where I attempted suicide by overdosing myself of medicine and most of my family members and relatives is mad at me for doing that and my brother wishing that I didn't survive. But I'm still living the rest of my life by not doing it again and focusing myself into art.,"The experience that I will never forget is when I'm alone and unwinding myself being away with the people I know, it's calming and I'm able to let go of heavy- pack feelings in a specific place where it's just me."
"Back in kindergarten there was this boy that, for reasons I never truly understood besides for the ""she's timid so she won't tell anyone"" bullied  me for either my appearance, clothing, hair and how much I would eat. I ended up being in school with this boy in elementary and middle school as well and the other male classmates would support his doings, teachers would pretend to not see anything and the rest of the people simply didn't care enough to say or do something about it. With time I realized this person was like that because he probably had a crush on me and tried to make it as less noticeable as possible; now that I think about it he got mad when I ended up in a relationship with another classmates and texted me once to ask me if I wanted to date him. Still, because of that I have an hard time trust people when I first meet them, especially if they are guys. I'm aware this is not a rational though to have and I surrounded myself with people that would disprove these intrusive thoughts everyday just by being friends with me.","Starting high school I had completely new classmates and I could start from scratch, during the end of the first year I ended up deskmate with this guy that was very passionate of horror movies, drawing and videogames. We got along pretty well and next year we would start to go out on Saturday afternoons immediately after school, sometimes his parents would invite me for some trip and thanks to them I saw a lot of beautiful places that I would not have the chance to see if it wasn't for him. To me we were just friends but he actually had feelings for me, that I would reciprocate the year after. We started our relationship on 10 February of 2018 and we're still together. We are going to celebrate our anniversary and Valentine and I couldn't be happier."
"Good day!
My brother, whom I will call, K, has attempted suicide at least 8 times. He has starved himself too, as of late. This has been, as you could imagine, very rough on my mental health!
Not to mention my mom's HORRID mental state, whom has almost died 30 times. My family did not talk to each other for 5 years, which sucked, since I love my cousins.","Um, no major events where our family was bonding have happened, like, we don't hate each other, but nothing major or significant has happened that would be like: OMG OU FAMILY IS SO GOOD! Ya know?"
I was involved in a pretty major conflict with my brother when he decided to get married.  I was personally against it because I felt like he was doing it for the wrong reasons and that later down the line it would backfire and he would be extremely unhappy.,"I rarely have conflicts with people I don't consider close since I don't really care too much and I have a very thick skin.  I do get in conflicts occasionally while gaming.  While playing a mmorpg, myself and several others go into a fight over where we wanted to form our base.  I wanted to form it somewhere safe and relatively easy for our group of players while they wanted to form it someplace that would be difficult to hold."
"When I was in 6th grade I was losing one of my closest friends, because of a friend there. But we are better now.",Me and my friends doing fun activities together without worry
"Well there were lots of times but my Parents used to fight a lot, and I was antisocial only trying to make friends now which has been difficult since I never had any I have been influence by already bad kids that used to hangout around. There were many times some being around money other times was me being an annoying kid which ended with my mom choking me out one time.","The only conflict that didn‚Äôt involve something bad was me being alone drawing, and playing games it made me dependent on devices for happiness."
I used to have this friend that would constantly try to controll any and all other friendships I had- whether it was getting mad at me for spending time with someone else or straight up lying and spreading rumors. All throughout my childhood it was constant on and off fighting because of this,I joined an after school club with one of my friends and have been happily participating and having fun
"I don't quite understand what you mean by ""experience"" but I'll answer the best I can. So a event that led to conflict with my family is when I struggled at school, now I won't say what grade/level because I prefer to keep that private but the gist of it is I was doing poorly in school which automatically lead to conflict with my family who thought I could've done so much better if I tried harder. But I've got through that through destressing by practicing my hobbies mostly art and eventually everything was fix.","Well an event that didn't lead to conflict and instead actually lead to my family liking me more is when I did a park clean up, so there was a park that was disgusting, people basically used the park as a dump so I worked with some people to clean it up. And that didn't lead to my family having problems with me, quite the opposite actually."
"Sexual abuse, no need to explain further. ","Ahh.... I didn't really understand the question, I guess spending time with my father and giving me attention is good after abandoning me, right? "
"I have had a lot of conflict with my family as I have grown up.. My father was mentally and physically abusive towards my family. When I was younger I vividly remember being yelled at for crying because I was in pain by my father, my brother did not take this well and caused a fight with my father. A physical one. This has impacted the way I display my feelings, making me feel guilty for even crying or being in pain due to feeling like I am complaining.

Another conflict is me coming out as transgender (FtM) to my mother. My mother has narcissistic tendencies and tends to make any situation about HER. Where as when I asked if I could get on testosterone, she turned it into an argument. ""Do you know how this makes me feel?"" Sentences like that.","My brother is someone who has really been there for me as I have gotten older. One thing that I can remember where something about me and how I felt didn't cause conflict, as an example, is me coming out as transgender. (FtM) Despite being very worried about how he was going to view me after this, he was very accepting and supporting. And frankly, so have my other siblings. My siblings have never really had conflict with me, luckily we're all very close. "
I had to tell a friend that I no longer could be friends with him as the relationship was extremely toxic and deteriorated my mental health.,I went on a road trip with my dad to see my long distance boyfriend
"Oof there are a few. My parents divorce, I hated my mother for cheating on my dad but I made piece with that because I‚Äôve grown up and see it different now. I don‚Äôt hate my mother anymore. ","Well, when I was younger I had many friends because I am a funny and very open person. But I had to learn quick that things are different when the tone of your skin is and you are gay. Friends I had back then, I grew up with, backstabbed me because of that. It honestly hurt. I did not forgive them since today. "
"May of 2018, I was going through an ATAR course for Human Bio. An ATAR course is another form of Extension, or higher classes than mainstream (Australian Terms). During this time, I had been researching anatomy, specifically for areas around the vertebrae, due to the course's focus being based around areas such as this during the weeks we had been given to study. A few weeks into my course, a friend had dropped out of ATAR, since she had apparently gotten pregnant from another student in a few grades lower than us, which was not only illegal at the time, but was extremely uncalled for, considering she had been a higher AP student for a few years. Of course, I had stayed in ATAR for the rest of my schooling years after this event. There was quite a lot of conflict between our friend group at the time revolving around this specific event, which eventually resulted in my friend dropping out of school due to anxiety attacks and a drop in mental health. It turns out that it was a false positive, as she had only taken one test, before taking a few more after she had dropped out. Not wanting to enrol back into our grade, she became a drop out a year before graduation and was unsuccessful in her career for several years before being hired as a personal nurse in a mental asylum. Looking back on this event, I don't have any regrets as to how my friends and I reacted to our friends alleged pregnancy.","Revolving around the same group of people, we had an exam for our ATAR course a the same year, earlier than the past event. Generally when our previous school was allowed to study with others and take notes, there would be some conflict involved with students over false notations and sabotage towards other students during study. However, when my friends and I studied together, it was surprisingly peaceful as we cooperated with one another quite well and managed to pass our course for that semester."
Well I say there was 1 conflict with this bully back in high school it gotten so bad to the point I had pure hatred for him. So what I do? Simple I just beat him until he was on the ground and I walked away ,I say when I was hangin out with a couple of my friends there was no conflict really we were just chilling and Vibin. 
"I'm fighting with my boyfriend.  He has a problem with alcohol.  I'm afraid of him when he's drunk.  It saddens me, before I could not foresee that he had these problems.  I feel cheated and disappointed.","I live in Ukraine, to be more precise in Kharkov.  This is an experience that I wouldn't wish on anyone.  At some point, explosions become part of your normal day.  And the window knocked out by the shock wave seems like luck, because your house is intact and you are alive.  Better than winning the lottery.  Maybe that's why my drawings are depressing"
"There was an issue with one of my friend's ex boyfriend harrassing them at school, and me and that friend had to tell a trusted adult to help with the situation",Me and my friends went out to see a movie together during the weekend
well my parents had a fight that led to divorce: my dad was mad that our old car would'nt start ( it was a station wagon from the 1900's no shit it was trash ) and threw some wine bottle at my mom. i was in the room next to them.,"well once my family ( this is 4 years before the above mentioned divorce fight ) lived across from a same-sex marrige couple. they where nice, and we liked them ( or i did, my parents only kinda liked them since they where and my mom still is a cristain ) but they where moving to god knows where, and could not bring their dog. well my mom asked for the dog and now i have my dog murphy."
"The worst conflict i can remember was between me and my family in with i do not have much contact nowdays. I was 17 and my cousin 20. One day he let his phone unlocked in my bedroom, and as a curious person, i decided to take a look. Unfortunately for me, i found out that night one of the things that broke me the most. In short, he was doing illegal stuff with underaged girls. Concerned, i screenshotted and decided to tell my mom about it, in with she acted like it was nothing and pretended to have a bad reaction after pointed it. She later, with me insisting a lot, send it to my aunt, that had the same reaction, with an addition of saying that ""she don't mind as long as he does not get caught"". I, of course, got really mad and started arguing asking them why they don't mind and how they do not see how dangerous this is, in with just lead me to having my face slapped for being ""overdramatic"". Later in the year i came out of the closet saying i was gay, and for (not much of) my surprise, my family would rather have a pedo member than a gay one. 
I got yelled a lot.","A week ago, me and my current partner were in the couch watching something dumb on YouTube as usual. We laughed a lot, and had a nice time without any conflict."

"I have had an issue with my niece, where she pulled a knife on my pregnant sister. I had to pull her away and she tried kicking my sister's belly, causing possible harm to my sister and her child. I had restrained my niece and got the weapon away from her, it really worried me and during that year (when my niece stayed with us) we had had several other conflicts. I had nearly killed her at one point because I couldnt take the pain anymore and I thought it was either her(niece) or me. We are okay now and we had time to calm down and think things over, but I will never forget the fear in her eyes, when I was about to choke her.","This is a hard one for me to answer as I am a person who tends to focus on the negatives, but one experience was when I was with my brother and we had bonded over a game. It was nice to see him not be mad 24/7 and it was something that brought us closer. He doesnt realize how much that game changed my view of him, but Im happy that I got to see him in a different light. I know he has gone through a lot of stuff and struggles with PTSD, but I will not forget the joy we shared over a game "
It was when my old mom was very mean to me when I was younger,I don‚Äôt remember as much but it had to do with leaving a place
"Since i turned 20 years old last month, i always felt like i was allowed to do whatever i wanted and not be forced to be responsible. A few weeks ago for instance, I had to clean my room by filling at least one trash bag a day. But I didn't want to. I just wanted to stay on my bed and surf the internet like i always do. My mom would constantly bombard me to do as I was told and I eventually lost my temper. We had yelled up and down the stairs about the situation, but I still wouldn't admit that she was right. We stopped fighting after that, but I still refused to fill a trash bag. I eventually sat down and cooled off, and finally decided that I have responsibilities and I can't avoid them when I want to. I finally got up and filled not one, but three trash bags of garbage from my room, and took them out. A few days later, me and my mom finally apologized to each other for losing our tempers. That's the most recent piece of conflict i could think of.","Relating to my previous statement, I have been diagnosed with autism and would occasionally lose my temper when something doesn't go my way. I've mostly experienced this all the time at school, but there was one instance where it kinda got out of control. There was an assignment me and my class had to do. This was back in 10th grade, but I still can't remember what the assignment was. Anyway, as usual, I would throw a fit about not wanting to do the assignment that they sent me to the office. However, instead of going to the office, I decided to run away from school, despite being aware i shouldn't do so. I packed everything and snuck off the campass. I went on a very long walk with the intention of walking back home. It wasn't until I walked near the train tracks that i lived across from that one of my teachers was driving around looking for me and he told me to get in his car and he drove me back to the school. I can't really remember what happened afterwards, but I knew that I was not going to do that again. I eventually finished the assignment."

"There was a time my younger sister had drug issues and was a rebellion teen. At the time I no longer lived with my mother so wasnt to much informed about the issue. One night my sister came home on somthing and was acting bizarre. She got in an argument with my mother and wanted to run away but my mother locked her up in her room which was a 2 floor house and called me to help. When my sister found out I was coming she said ""for what? She done abandoned us for her father's part of the family"" (which we were not all from the same fathers). I got so angry I ended up slaping her and that made her fight back by wanting to tackle me down. When I was about to take my first swing my mother steped in to separate us and I accidentally hit her instead of my sister. From there on we stoped fighting and all was forgiven.","From the past story already listed, everytime there is an argument between my little sister and I we always think about the time we faught and when my mother walks in we just apologize each other and move on."

"Oh, where do I begin? First, there was that time where I thrown too many tantrums at Elementary School when things are not going exactly my way when it comes to school work and I always get restrained by getting my body slammed onto the floor. Then, there was that time where my dad and I got ourselves into a fistfight one time 'cause he has a habit of being an angry pot-bellied bitch that doesn't give a thousand fucks when living in a world full of assholes. And finally, I have a tendency to get spanked really hard by my father every time I've done something wrong, even if I didn't do it. So right now, I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown all because of those things I've been through. ","Aside from being a piece of angry shit that my father has a tendency to be, he does get to work outside in his workshop 'cause he's a mechanic among other things. He 'n I also get ourselves geeking out over vehicles both old and new. Especially when it comes to locomotives such as Steam Engines, Electric Engines, Diesels, Trolley's, and other railroad-based vehicles. And then, of course, we also geek out on airplanes, mostly antiques. And aside from my dad, I always hang out with my mom. She tries and comfort me in the best way she can. Although I do get tired of her nagging at me, trying to give suggestions that are taking too long, she and my dad are still my parents and will help me in any way they can. Even if am on the verge of a mental breakdown. "
"As a child, I experienced years of physical and mental abuse from a family member. As a teen, I found out my closest friend of about 5 years was talking behind my back. ","Semi-recently (about 4 months ago), my partner broke up with me because they weren't invested in the relationship anymore."
"A remarkable experience in my life generated by the conflict caused by a family member... Since I was a child I grew up with an alcoholic and drug addict uncle, a situation that I generate in my fear and insecurity with everything related to this world
An escape that I found from that situation was to draw and in this way create characters with incredible lives, lives that I wanted to have, either far removed from reality and even simple lives far from any conflict","If I had to mention a very nice experience that was far from any conflict, I would mention my first girlfriend, all the time I spent with her was wonderful in any sense"
"One of them, I distracted a group of people to get their attention towards my way so the person they were picking on (and what it seemed, about to be beaten up) could get away, I threw some half ass excuse (which they fell for) and went on my way.","I still haven't fixed one of my vehicles windshield wipers, they've been messed up since November =3"
"In high school it was real torture having to put up with bad attitudes from poorly paid teachers or classmates who were going to cause problems in order to get rid of their own problems at home, I understand them but there is no need to fall for problems for others or more than those that you already have in life, so I had nothing in common with any of my companions at that time, until the days passed and more companions began to arrive with whom I did have more things in common and little by little they became my friends. best friends and we created a group, during breaks we spent time talking about movies and series all about pop culture, while we drew and had competitions to see who drew the best, if they didn't call them nerds or geeks, but we didn't care and at least I was not alone and we had a lot of fun and we made our stay at the high school more bearable, more interesting and less boring.","When I was a child I was 6 years old, I had kidney disease, I drank a lot of soda and not water, the doctor sent me to rest, when I was at home resting they gave me a sketchbook and bought me a desk at night i had a high fever, but during the day i sat at my desk drawing and doing homework while watching tv; And so every day until I was cured and I remember all those days I went through and I didn't pay so much attention to my illness, spending hours focusing my mind only on art and drawings that didn't come out very well for me at that age and They were horrible, but I They loved it and I kept practicing visualizing that one day I would be a great artist, I'm not yet but I don't stop practicing to be better."
"This is slightly coincidental, since yesterday I had just done a school assignment about conflicts and relationships. An example of a conflict I‚Äôve had, is a major one I‚Äôd experienced with my younger sister. We are 5 years apart, but although we are as different as black amd white, we remain close. However, sibling relationships are never that simple. As sisters, we always argue and bicker, but this one conversation really scarred me. It may not seem like a big deal to many people, but it broke my heart.
 
Before I head to the conflict, allow me to give you some background information. I am known in my school and amongst my friends as ‚ÄòThe Writer‚Äô. I enjoy reading a bit too much and absolutely adore writing stories and essays. I tell my sister this interactive story which I dub ‚ÄòA Kingdom‚Äôs Quest‚Äô, and she enjoys it so much that she begs me to tell it to her every single day.

One day, I was writing a new chapter of a fantasy-romance book I was drafting, when my sister was trying to get my attention. My ignorance really pissed and annoyed her, and in a fit of anger, she slapped the phone out of my hand and said, in her own words: ‚ÄúSee, you‚Äôre not even listening to me! You‚Äôre just writing another pointless story!‚Äù

It may not seem like much, but those words hurt me. Hard. ‚ÄòAnother pointless story‚Äô? What she meant was that all my stories were pointless. This hit me really hard because I put my heart and soul into every sentence I type and say, and I had already decided a career in Literature in the near future. I cried for 2 hours after.

You may not understand, but this is one of the most major conflicts I‚Äôve had with my sister.","No conflicts? Interesting.

I have one, where it was an extremely awkward meeting with an ex-enemy, now frenemy or whatever, after a bunch of friendly texts. I said ‚ÄòHi.‚Äô and ran away. I have no idea where our relationship status is now.

Another, when I was in kindergarten, a nice boy indirectly confessed to me by telling me his ‚ÄòMy Little Pony‚Äô-based dream. He went to a different school and I never saw him again.

My current bestie met when we were waiting to get our height-and-weight taken. We bonded by talking about stupid boy crushes."
"Had a really bad argument with my wife on whether I should take care of my berriden mother, it got so bad we were almost ready to divorce, she argued I should leave her for my brother and sister to take care of her even tho they are overseas. I finally said I would give everything up before I let my mother alone on time of need. My mom is now living with us. ","My previous boss was and will slways be an asshole, je is the reason why I gathered all my courage and stopped having a reg job an dedicated my life to art. He would make me work 14 hours a day. 7 days a week sometimes months would pass before me having a dsy off."
"Once I was craving ice cream and there was some in the freezer, but both cups were for my boyfriend (I don't remember if I ate mine or just bought one less cup initially). I asked if it was possible to have a second ice cream, but was refused, and honestly did not eat it until the very evening, when my partner returned home. By that moment, I almost felt suffering,  I swear, I wanted this ice cream _so much_ ="")
And the first thing my boyfriend did when he got home, was grab one of the ice cream cups and immediately ate it in front of me! I was so indignant and angry at this, that I took the second ice cream and ate it immediatey!
Aaand we didn't talk for a next day, cause now he's got offended too. And we were both offended and angry at each other, until we finally discusse this situation, and turned out that my boyfriend just wanted to rid me of the temptation as quickly as possible, and did not expected how much the way he chose could hurt me. Well, to be honest, I didn't expect that either =D

Actually, it was not about food as such, but about misunderstanding other people's motives and feeling, so talking really solved this problem. This absurd situation happened about two years ago, and since then we have learned to understand each other better, so we didn't have so serious quarrels again (and hopefully wouldn't) =)","I was given a cool bicycle that I sincerely adore. But it so happened that it broke several times in a row, and I took it to be repaired (in the same place where it was bought, by the way), and they fixed it, and then it broke again, repeat. And I was very angry about it, so much so that during the last visit to the workshop, I raised my voice to the person working there. To be honest, I am ashamed of this, and I really wanted to apologize, but I did not find the strength to do so, and bike was picked back home from the workshop by my boyfriend. And since then for almost the half year the bike mysteriously has not broken down again, so I was not in that workshop again too, and this whole situation has no progress at all  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"

 So we're sitting on the group desk and I remember this one moment where our old teacher tells us what job we want, he tells her that he wanted to be a youtuber who only plays doors (atleast  from what I remember). So I decide to bring it randomly while we're talking.

Turns out apparently I had false memory according to him and he doesn't wanna spend the rest of his days making exclusively roblox doors content for youtube so yeah.","Honestly, most of the people I know aren't the problem, it's mostly just my inner demon telling me that this and that don't really look good enough on my art and stuff since I don't really go outside unless I have to.

 But this one time whilst drawing on huionsketch, I made this stupid watercolour brush because the thing I downloaded the huion sketch brushes from wasn't loading (it was probally because i had the time set to august 30th to make the damm thing work).
 It was basically just like a transparent bleeding pen that I could do some shit shading with and pray to God it gave me the effect I want because my oil brush was broken and i felt like doing some watercolour. Ended up switching back to the broken oil painting brush and temporarily fixing it since that brush was just that bad. Still used it for the clouds tho :D"

She often uses the fact that she ‚Äúcarried me for nine months‚Äù as an excuse for taking my stuff. I love her dearly, though. I often when I get angry or sad I will draw art to vent or write poems. I used to pile up all my emotions until I would blow up. Now that I use art and writing to express my emotions I‚Äôve learned to control them better. Art has also helped me understand that someone will always be better than me, and I‚Äôm okay with that. I‚Äôm doing my best and that‚Äôs okay.","I‚Äôve done a lot. I like drawing, as you most likely know. My family and friends have influenced and motivated me a lot through my journey. When I feel strong and good emotions I draw a lot. I get scared to show my art sometimes due to the fact that I like gore and an anime/cartoony art style. I have a huge imagination and zone out a lot. When I draw I get these ideas out on paper. Colors are ways that help me express emotions through art. When I draw I feel like I did at least something right within my life. It is a creative way to make my friends and I smile.

My mom appreciated him asking him that and told me to be more nice, even though I did hurt his feelings. I told Mom to back off and went my way for a Sunday activity, and once I arrived, I went to the restroom to explode my emotion of anger and hurt. Mom then arrived with someone else by her side and took me home. On our way there, she understood how I feel about my brother dating someone. Having high-functioning autism in my system caused all of the conflicts in my family so far, causing my life to be more unfair than the other members of my family.","Well, I don't have a lot of experiences that didn't involve with any of my friends, family, or significant others - in which I don't have a significant other because I'm single. But I remember the time when my mom and I were talking in a car, arriving at a restaurant, where I discussed none of my problems, but showing empathy towards my sister. Now, this isn't a conflict, but rather an empathetic way for me to know how my sister feels. I told my mom that if I was in my sister's shoes, I would just try to find some space to find inner peace, saying that I wasn't ready for a relationship, for a job, for marriage, etc. So Mom understood how I feel as well. At least it was rather a way to find inner peace in a few ways. "

The man couldn't handle being incorrect about a situation, made shit up, and didn't like how I called him out. After many threats to me, I went to his house to grab some of my shit for work the next day, and also have a conversation with him; this does not go well. As I read a text message that he sent me out loud to him, he proceeds to stomp up the stairs, grabs my wrist, and tries to bend my hand enough so that he makes me drop the phone. After I push him away, he proceeds to hit me and attempts to choke me. In my efforts to get him off of me, he received some minor injuries, while received the most significant. The police did nothing at all because it didn't seem ""one-sided"" enough for my dad to be charged. If he were to ever do it again though, there is a report in the system. In the event something like this happens again, he would be charged to a heavier extent. ","My parents and I went to Disneyworld when I was eight.

I really dislike his presence the majority of the time, so as soul crushing as it is, I was forced to watch as we became more distant. It still hurts me that that leech pried one of my only two friends away from me, so the bitterness and resentment I feel towards him is unimaginable, because I really like Luc, but it‚Äôs just he‚Äôs always with that guy, no matter what I do, it never changes, so it‚Äôs not something I can really change because even if Luc told him to take a hike and find a new thing to leech off of, the guy would just pester Luc until Luc capitulates and they become friends again.","Actually, it happened quite recently.

But two weeks ago I had a doctors appointment, so we had to postpone, then I couldn‚Äôt find the the energy, so we postponed again, and then I had yet another appointment, so we postponed fir a third time. They were really nice about it though, and it makes me feel awful to waste so much of their time like that."
"Mum didn't trust me to sort out the freezer. Or migrate one single icecream container to the other freezer. 
Her storming to the room pressured me to jam the drawer I was working on closed, so I could retrieve the food container she asked for just before storming in, which was in the drawer bellow. She cornered me in the small room and got pissed at me for jamming the drawer and complained that I'd crack it like the one above it (it is cracked due to her filling it with heavy produce(I keep trying to migrate the heavy stuff to the bottom drawer but she keeps slowly shifting it back up)). She stuck her backside up at me (she is generally very gross and I don't want to even be near her, she sets off my filth anxiety) when retrieving a food container, then left. 
I complained about it afterwards. And she yelled at me for complaining because she's been cooking all day!!(true) and is all tired and stressed!!! but in the end she just made unessersary stress for herself. She could have just let me move the container, something I'm fully capable of doing, but she took it upon herself to ask for it, then charge at me, causing me to fumble, then pushing me out and taking over the whole task.
She constantly does this all the time, forcibilbly taking over tasks or controlling areas (in the most messy haphazard way leaving crap everywhere) and then complaining that she's stressed and that everyone else is lazy.
She complains that I don't cook yet doesnt even trust me to boil fucking eggs(she didn't even trust my egg timer either).","I scheduled a movie watch together time with a close friend whom I only meet some 4 times a year, but on the day I had a breakdown (due to mum being gross). I texted friend that I couldn't go and she texted back that it's ok and we can try n go on a different day. We talked about lizards and stuff. Not as good as seeing a movie together. But it was......nice."
"growing up as a kid i'd often get bullied by my sister and mocked for my own race by my own family. everytime i'd tell my parents about the bullying and racism i recieved as a child they never did anything to help or reassure me, at all. my sister was the biggest bully i've had as a child. she also assaulted me several times. and also tried to kill me by drowning me in the pool.",i used to play dolls all the time with my sister. it was fun though.
ive seen alot of death in my past mostly my grandparents,that i acutally dont know yet
"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was fairly young, and have been medicated for it since I was about 13.  Because of my compulsive tendencies, I often conflicted with my mother, who would stop me from doing things I tried to do.  This may have built in me a dual set of impressions about myself and others; one is that I cause problems, and the other is that everything I try to do will be thwarted by something or someone.","While working at a summer camp, I performed a one-man puppet show of Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky poem; that and crafting video edits give me the feeling of a solid life accomplishment."
"I asked my father if he could think of any reason that i would tend to self sabotage when I feel strong anger. He got defensive, he doesn't trust peoples intent and, I'm deeply frustrated that his inflexible beliefs' stop us truly connecting. This was me before 2022. I've had a major perception shift, he's unlikely to create the turmoil in his mind necessary for this shift plus, he's old.","I procrasti-called my good friend, we were both working. He answered, I felt happy because I was receiving reinforcing signals within my body to remain connected with others and especially my chosen family/tribe. We discussed: work, next appointment deets, shared some random disconnected pieces of knowledge just for fun, our impressions of some music and both agreed to leave it there until next time.

I've now re-read your question and my understanding of it has changed, perhaps further away from it's actual intent. I will answer it now with awesome brevity: I was really connected to my feelings of excitement when I knew that I was going to return to riding my bicycle everywhere again."
"When I was living with my little sister, my nephew and I had opposing astrology signs and as a result we didn't get along very well in the beginning. We were both guilty of being instigators as well as getting annoyed with one another. Eventually my sister sat us both down and explained the absolute necessity for us to respect one another and find a solid way to coexists without being at odds. After that talk, there was a gradual learning curve from both of us. We learned to recognize instigation and rather than react in the moment, to bring it to my sister's attention. She would then concisely and effectively correct the behavior. After that adjustment period, my nephew and I grew very close.","My wife and I have exceptional limitation within our relationship. We've never had the typical problems many other couples seem to have whereing they fight or argue. Our struggle has always been to overcome the limitations so we can be closer psychoemotionally and to bond on all levels that we can. We are very much in love, but despite the absence of conflict, our story is a bit of a sad one sometimes."
"When I was 4 years old I lost my great grandmother and ever since then I have blamed myself for her death. I still get flashbacks to that very day when I was a small 4 year old, scared to do anything even when she was crying out for help.",I never really had any that I k ow of.
"My partner (male, 55) gave his daughter (14) permission to get her septum pierced, he himself didn't even agree with it but he gave it anyways because, in my opinion, he lacks the ability to cope with family conflict. We did have a couple heating, albiet brief discussions about it, because I don't agree with kids getting piercings, especially when they're as dirty, rude, and lazy and his, but he'd rather experience no friction than being a proper parent. Eventually I gave up, because after 5 years I know when something's futile. She's also not my kid, so I can't bring myself to give a shit lol","I experienced countless, daily conflicts while working at the animal shelter, sometimes people are very enraged with the service we offered, if we didn't have room for a surrender or stray. Once a man threw a cat inside the office and ran out and burned off in his truck. At the end of the day, it was easy for me to let go of my ego about how he treated me and prioritize the distressed cat. We truly didn't have room for her, so we had to invent something in a storage room, but it wasn't her fault what had been done to her. Most of the time I just de escalated people's emotions by repeating what they said back to them to make it clear I understood their emotions. It was a skill that has paid in dividends over my life."
"Family member found a new religion and became a fundamentalist.  I tried to quietly reason with them for 20 years then, when they said something rotten about another family member's marriage,  kicked them out of my life.

"As a child I was diagnosed with adhd, I was the 3rd out of 4 of my parents children. I was also the only neurodivergent person in the house, and quickly my parents learned they didn‚Äôt know how to deal with my ‚Äúproblems‚Äù and resorted to wrestling 8 y/o yo me to get his way. One day when I was young, young enough to be remembering things ig, I remember having a meltdown because I hated the feeling of the shirt on my back (I had sensory problems) and dad couldn‚Äôt deal with it and ended in me being dragged down the hallway, screaming and crying as I went. ",We would always go down to the park near the beach for my birthday and we‚Äôd have cake and fish and chips and everything was so calm. 
"It was a few months ago. I...don't PICK a side in conflicts or opinions, and my friends were telling me about how the other people in our class were telling them things that wasn't really all that nice. I mean, I SAW it happen, but for some reason, I wanted to know the other side of the story. Throughout the weeks, my friends avoided a lot of insults from them. Until one day, it just blew up. They had a verbal fight - and the teachers weren't there. Our class president couldn't stop the chaos - everyone was heated. I stood there, watching the fight unfold. No matter how much I wanted to interfere and take my friends' side...I COULDN'T. It felt against my nature.","Unexpected situations. Yeah, well, there's a lot - might not fit in the box."
All my life I've been emotionally neglected by my friends and family. They always treated me like a joke and i constantly felt like they didn't care about me.,My s/o makes me feel good and accepted now in life. We have similar interests and for once i feel cared for and loved in my life.
I don't have been in this kind of situation,I had a debate with a freind about the retirement age
"When i was in middle school, this group of kids would call me and my friend racially directed insults and they would treat us like animals, they said you couldn‚Äôt sit their when the seat was open, wouldn‚Äôt let you step where they step or anything.",When i was in fourth grade on this girl and I told her and she screamed ‚ÄúIM NOT A LESBIAN‚Äù and it just made me really upset
"I was treated badly by my Finnish biological father when I was little. He only cared about my twin sister so I was for the most part a shadow. He hit me and said that I was trash. So he caused me to develop PTSD, so every time he came I went hiding (my parents are split up). I've still got PTSD, but I can handle it so well that I didn't require any assistance with it. My ADHD was at its worst back then. You see, I've got adhd, dyslexia, autism and gender dysphoria on an extreme level. But now days I know my strengths and weaknesses.","I've always been scared of people viewing me weirdly due to me being Transgender (male to female, only got bottom surgery left) I used to actively hide behind others on the street so I wouldn't be looked at, despite that the feeling was only mental and wasn't something that happened. I also want to add that I ran into a glass door with my right arm when I was younger so I lost my sense of feel in 4 fingers and general motor control. So I'm physically unable to illustrate/write properly and creating anime art has always been a dream of mine. But this changed when I found AI, now I can do something that I've dreamed about doing. I enjoy making artwork extremely much.

I had a friend that was depressed and going through a hard time and was blaming part of it on me and I tried to help but they only pushed me away. We're still amazing friend and we don't ever talk about that.,I was having a hard time and had a breakdown down during lunch at school and one of my friends (This is a different one) saw that I was sad and helped me by getting me help and having me talk to a teacher. (I was sad because I had all these negative thoughts about myself) 
My father's toxic behavior.,Being overworked at my last job.
Well my brother is a bit negative so we argue a lot,When me and my mom play some video games
"I guess the worst I can really think of, is something that happened when I was about 7 years old. My grandpa invited me and my brothers on a camping trip, without our parents. I thought it would be fun, I loved camping, but I didn't know much about Grandpa or his, at the time, girlfriend, Maggie. This trip was on this little mountainside with a beach at the bottom. It was pretty fun but almost all my memories of that place are bad thanks to that hag my grandpa married. 

So, important thing to know about me, I have autism. No one knew, not even me, until I was officially diagnosed at age 16. (I'm 19 now as my profile says). Thing is, this made childhood, socializing, and a few other things kind of... difficult for me. For example, Something I've grown to notice; is I often say what's on my mind. blunt honesty. to the point it can unintentionally offend people. So, it sometimes can be hard for me to make and keep friends. So, as a kid, I did my best to socialize and meet as many people as I can and make as many friends as possible. And I didn't know Maggie until this trip nor any of the other people I met and don't remember on the trip. So, needless to say, I wasn't exactly a welcome presence. I ""talked too much"" for Maggie's liking (fucking hypocritical bitch- she was talking SO much more than I was to her adult friends) and when I got mad and, for once, left the space that upset me by going to another table, Maggie insulted me again and decided to give me the nickname Angelica after that brat from Rugrats. (Also, my name real name isn't anything close to that, so it confused me a lot)

So, not long after, she wouldn't let me leave the trailer to go say hi to more of my relatives who were also on this camping trip. not even the ones right next to us! she did this often, but the messed-up part? She let my brothers, at the time 4 and 3, wander and do whatever the fuck they wanted! I think the worst part, was on the 2nd day, (we were only staying for 3) me and my brothers wanted to go down to the beach. to play in the water a little. She said no to our swimsuits and sent some bitchy teenagers to watch us who CLEARLY didn't want to. So, Maggie and Grandpa told us to not get wet, kind of hard to do with clumsy kids under 5. So when we got there, we rolled up our pants and played in the gentle waters. I was taller and walked in a bit deeper than my brothers. sadly, they decided to also go in deeper. 

Thing is, even with TWO YOUNG ADULTS THERE, I was punished with 3 FUCKING HOURS OF TIME OUT all by myself, in the trailer, just because a little of the rolled-up part of my brother's pant's got wet. I WISH I had more common sense like now because I totally would've stood up for myself and not obeyed... but, I ended up suffering the punishment for a mistake that literally fixed itself by the time we got back to the campsite. yea I did not have a good time there. At all. and the next morning, when we were packing to leave, Maggie yelled loudly at me with the name ""angelica"" because it would just be HORRIBLE to call me by my real name. and because I forgot, I didn't answer. yea basically all I remember was Maggie making the trip horrible.

I never let it go because I never got to talk with her and explain that she upset me. literally been over a decade and I still haven't forgotten or forgiven her. I would go into the argument I had with my grandpa a couple years ago regarding the incident, but I've gotten emotional enough already... besides this message is far longer than it needs to be lol- but yea, to put the ending simply, I still hate Maggie and don't ever want to see her again unless I get to talk shit to her, I hate my grandpa now and don't want to see or speak to him either, and I don't consider either of them family anymore :)

sorry for dumping all that on you- I haven't had many chances to really talk about this...","One of my favorite memories of my family was at my graduation. Even if my grandma on my dad's side (his parent's divorced so this was his mom, not Maggie) was there, I still had a great time and felt really accomplished while I was there. Even if I slightly feared what came ahead, I felt pretty damn confident that day. I mostly had fun though with my mom and grandparents on my mom's side, they spoke to me a bit more and they definitely do better with me than my brothers or my dad's mom-. (I just said it that way so you didn't get confused- I do still mostly consider her family.) But thankfully everyone behaved, and my dad's mom didn't start drama. "
"I have an older sister who I fight with quite often. She says it is because we have so much in common, but I feel it‚Äôs the opposite. I feel like every decision I make is a bad one and others would be better off without me.  I can never tell if I‚Äôm the toxic sister or if it is her.","Another one of my siblings and I have a strong bond even if we still fight, but that‚Äôs not unusual for siblings. We do lots of things together. We enjoy the same food and music. We also feel comfortable telling each other things that we wouldn‚Äôt tell our parents. We trust each other. "

"Well, I have hard-working parents and I greatly admire them for taking care of my family, but there is one big tic I have with my mother. She is a sweet lady, but... She has a large spending habit, and my dad happens to be the only one who is working for money. She‚Äôll get mad at my dad for not giving her money to spend on a mobile poker game app. I know it doesn‚Äôt sound much, but the amount of money she puts into it is more than thousands. I felt bad for my dad, so I tried to talk to her if it was to the point of addiction. She of course, ignored me. She‚Äôs not really the type to argue with me. I hope I could help her in some way, shape, or form.","Even with all the conflict, I feel like my family means more than anything to me. I remember talking to my dad about my soon graduation, and how I‚Äôll be leaving my family independently. It‚Äôs a sad thought knowing that I won‚Äôt be able to see my family for four years in the military, but my dad didn't stop me from making my own choices, even if they're going to be tears falling from my siblings and especially my mom from the choice I make of wanting to go to the military. My dad told me I have to make my own choices, and never be pushed by others. Because he knows who I am. A follower, not a leader. But he believes that, I can be my own leader one day. I'm still eighteen, but I know what I want to do. I told my dad, that I‚Äôll help him. I‚Äôll help my whole family."
My brother and I had gotten into a violent argument over the way he was treating a female friend of mine. He was drunk. When I confronted him. He attacked me. Breaking my front two teeth. ,I spent a day exploring a new city. I made a lot of new friends. And decided to move there immediately. 
"Mum and dad don‚Äôt live together so I have to travel to see my dad who lives ins different country but in a drivable distance. When I was 10, there was a mix up between me spending time with my dad and my mum wanting back at her house because of other plans. They both argued on the phone until my mum drove over to my dads house to pick me up. Where they argued more. I was meant to go a friends house a day or two later and I was feeling so down and guilty because I thought that the problem was because of me. To this day that I‚Äôm nearly 17 it scares me to see my parents argue like that again because I know I‚Äôm the reason why mum and dad still know each other. ","I‚Äôve had few fights in school because of my messed up and angered personally from hanging around the wrong people who are called‚Äùgaslighters‚Äù which is where people start trouble between other people through lies and controlling them. I was 15 and I had been severely wound up throughout the day through ‚Äúgaslighters‚Äù and I was still suffering and worrying about my mum who had cancer at the time. One afternoon, it was the end of the school day and in the last lesson I was tested to a boiling point from one person. After the lesson finished I followed him and he came towards me knowing I wanted to fight him and we fought badly until it was clearly obvious that I‚Äôd overcome him and beat him badly. Later that night the fight really affect me and I tried to take my one life by strangling myself with a scarf in which I backed out midway through. "
"I usually avoid conflict, so i don't have much to say here. The biggest conflict we had was a small arguing about my drinking.",Everything else
"Conflict follows me, maybe I seek it, I like debate. But to be honest, I also like mitigation and compromise. Rarely have a burned a bridge and not put it out. I have often been the instigator of these conflicts with friends, significant others, sometimes family members, usually starting with me thinking I was wronged, sometimes that is true, but not always. I then burn the bridge, and upon a debate I find out if it was a misunderstanding. This has made me hard to deal with but I prefer this, as I constantly am put in a position of not receiving the honest truth and sometimes a debate or argument is the only way to bring it out.","I feel when given the truth, difficult as it may be, I operate in a way that is beneficial to everyone, usually treating everyone much better. But it is tough, my mind doesn't allow good to exist without condition, however when I am given info that is good but not great I tend to do nice things for people and get less agitated or suspicious."

"I never thought it would be so easy for me to answer this question! I have one very important conflict with my parents. the fact is that we all live in Russia and they support the war, but I do not. In addition, my mother is Ukrainian herself - she was born in Chernihiv, my grandmother is buried there! I could not even imagine how much propaganda can be effective! my parents laugh at me when we talk about it, they say I don't know anything. I'm an adult, I'm 30 years old, I can form my own opinion about this, and I probably know more than they do, but they don't care. This is my greatest disappointment and pain in life. We all think that our parents are good. But no.

I am hated along with everyone because I was born in this country and there is nothing I can do.","I hope I understood the question correctly. A few years ago, I decided to confess to my parents that I had become a pagan. my mother is a Christian and became very devout in her old age so I was worried. to my surprise, she took it calmly, although it seems to me that she does not take it seriously, as if I were a child who decided to play. nevertheless, I‚Äôm glad that we don‚Äôt have real conflicts about this (besides the fact that for some reason she still congratulates me on Orthodox holidays, I ask her not to do this)"

"That's a little hard to answer as I have conflict with my family every day. Not just shallow ones, big ones that make me question my sanity and sense of self. On the side of my significant other, however, we had a fight recently regarding time for one another. We're both college students; her in the medical field, and me in the arts. We struggle to find time for one another sometimes and it's a constant battle that I don't really mind, because at this point, long distance entails more than that, so I have to expect bigger conflicts than this.

"When I was adult already - married and with children - it was revealed my father had an extramarital child. We did not get very well along with my father anyway at that point, because he is an irritating, grumpy guy full of himself, even though one could hardly say his life turned successful in any respect. It wasn't a real conflict, but more of an abandon situation and as years go by we only keep courteous contacts, though we do not fight. I don't think I had any real conflicts in-family. My step sister broke all contact with me after the initial relations were established and I do not intend to renew it.","It's difficult to choose one. I'm in my mid-40s and been through better and worse times. I server in the army (compulsory service at that time) and I lived my childhood on the Soviet side of the iron curtain. Both of these were difficult at times.

On the other hand I still have a great family even thought we've been through hard times. I used to go abroad quite a lot when I was younger and I've seen plenty of Europe. Already being an adult in my late 30s I published my first novel and that was a releasing experience that I liked very much.

There is plenty of stuff I might qualify as positive experience and in fact for the past few years I'm willing to say ""it's a good life"". Sure, difficult at times, and there are worries and problems to be solved, but all in all it's so stable and nice I got time to publish drawing on DA in my free time. It means much :D"
Um I guess my mom always compares me to my older brother she keeps forgetting I draw art to and always talks about his talent with drawing and singing and how smart he is and when I try and tell her it hurts my feelings she tells me I am overreacting ,Well the question doesn‚Äôt specify it has to be a bad experience so in my art class my teacher told me I have a musical hearing (English is not my first language so I don‚Äôt know how to say it correctly) with colors and that I have improved alot since we began the class. It made me feel happy and seen that maybe I have some kind of talent 
"This story begins in my childhood, an arrival in the world by forceps, which will leave a scar on my right cheek which I still carry at 68 years old. Very young, I will keep my distance from my comrades, on the one hand shy and on the other hand changing very often from primary school (Linked to my father's work). In addition, a somewhat macho father, he always tightened the screws on us so that we stayed in our place. But he always wanted us to defend ourselves if necessary, if we were the object of a physical attack. Despite everything, he often belittled me, for all types of ideas that I could put forward, it was stronger than him. He had trouble expressing and recognizing my abilities and qualities. Then one day, I was about 18 years old, during a very snowy and very cold winter (-20¬∞C), he wanted to start his car. He asked me to help him. But very quickly we fell out, saying that I was doing nothing good. So I rudely told him what I thought of him and left him in the middle of the road to fend for himself. Since that day, our relationships have been held with much more respect for each other.","I am an adult, I work in a state research center, and I face the world of work. A world that I live with these injustices, these non-recognition, these perversions. At the time I was a senior technician with over ten years of experience. And like any research team, a young engineer took the lead. At the start it is going well, good atmosphere of good relations, I realized that it was not going to last. The team leader regularly spoke up when I was asked a technical question and asked to answer. After which, other events will intervene, and I will see that it will not work out for my career. My advancement, my possibilities of taking on responsibilities will disappear in favor of him. His ambition was such that he ended up changing jobs and becoming head of the laboratory. One day during a retirement party for a former colleague, we met. A little surprised by his presence, he was distant with shifty gaze, he was at the back of the room and I was on the opposite side. After the traditional speeches, I made the decision to go greet him, to see his reaction and make him feel uncomfortable. It was nothing to us. We were going to talk like two adults who had things to talk about. At one point, he interrupted me and told me that he wanted to tell me his deepest thought.

I was in an abusive relationship with a woman that was good at being mentally abusive and pushing my male toughness self expectations. So I was really in a constant stress of demands and pressure and needed my father to help me in a desperate attempt of figuring a money situation. With all that she was doing to keep me on the edge of my mind boundaries in handling stress I asked my father about help how to find the money while we were chopping wood for the winter in the basement of the apartment building I was living in. He said that my woman's behaviour must change and he can't really give me money or advice. In the next second I realised I am standing with the axe in my hand and looking him with rage. I broke down. I couldn't imagine if I lost my sense for right and normal what would have happened. My father looked so desperate and upset by the whole thing. I hugged him and apologised. ,"Now I am in a happy longlasting relationship with another woman and the worst case for us is to disagree or solve a non heated argument in a very calm and talkative way.

"I will refer to myself as 'Party A' and to the other involved party as 'Party B'.
Party B consisted of multiple persons of differing ages.

The discussion was about the funeral rites and the funeral(two separate occasions), attending them, and their importance.

Party A thought that it should be enough to attend one of those, but Party B thought that it was relevant to attend both, if not for closure for Party A, then for the person who had died(the person was between ninety and one hundred years old), and to appease some of the involved family members, who thought it important for everyone to attend on both occasions.
The following argument was one of how useful attending both occasions was(the side of Party A) and that one should attend both (represented by Party B).
The argument started with Party A talking about, how, while they saw the societal expectations to attend funeral rights and/or the funeral was acceptable, they normally happened at basically the same time. And that only the refusal of the church representative to come to where the deceased wanted to be buried shouldn't result in Party A's inconvenience and financial loss.
Party B wasn't happy with that, and talked about how such things were important, using cultural and emotional arguments.
It then came to Party A's attention that, contrary to what they had been informed of prior to the argument, the reason for those two being held on separate occasions, was not only because of the church representative's refusal but also because the friends of the deceased would have difficulties arriving, as they themselves were of a high age as well.
As such, Party A accepted that it would be reasonable to attend both occasions, under the consideration of the deceased party's memories and probably also according to what they would have wished for.

The argument then mostly ended on that note, even if there was no complete agreement on the whys of the attending, but the agreement of party A to attend both occasions.
After that the meal continued, to Party A's best knowledge, peacefully.

","I am working under the assumption that the past experience should still involve a family member, friend, or significant other, just lacking conflict, and not an experience that did not involve 'conflict with a family member, friend or significant other'.

As such I chose the most peaceful situation involving another person that I could think of.

I am 'Party A' again, but this time, 'Party B' is my mother.

On occasion, (sometimes multiple times a week, but it may also not happen for months, Party A's sense of time(it being measured in the direction of entropy) is not compatible with the commonly used one, as they often are quite remote, and compare timescales with the age of the earth, or even the universe(the length of the existence of time itself)) Party A and Party B sit together and read books. While that may have been physical books, they are mostly digital ones by now, that always happens about the same way.
Party A and Party B sit together, maybe with something to drink(non-alcoholic, both Party A and Party B do not consume alcohol for pleasure or regularly), and read a book, it is never the same as the one the other party is reading, and rarely will there be conversation.
It is always a calm atmosphere though, and the silence never becomes uncomfortable, and this may sometimes only last for five minutes, but in other cases, they sit there for hours, only reading their book(or books) in silence."

"My name is Emily, and I've always known that something was off about my family. My parents would argue constantly, and my older brother would often disappear for days on end without any explanation. I didn't understand what was happening, but I could feel the tension in our home every day.

It wasn't until I turned 16 that I learned the truth. My parents sat me down one day and told me that my brother had a drug addiction and had been in and out of rehab for years. They had been keeping it a secret from me to protect me, but I couldn't believe they had lied to me for so long.

My brother's addiction had torn our family apart. My parents had spent countless hours and money trying to get him the help he needed, but he just kept relapsing. I felt helpless and lost, not knowing what I could do to help.

As the years went by, things only got worse. My brother started stealing from our family to fund his addiction, and my parents were at their breaking point. I tried my best to be there for them, but it was hard to watch them struggle with the trauma my brother's addiction had caused.

Eventually, my brother was arrested for drug possession, and my parents decided it was time to cut him out of their lives completely. It was a difficult decision, but they knew they had to do what was best for them and for me. I'm getting tears in my eyes just from writing this.

I was heartbroken. I loved my brother and didn't want to lose him, but I also knew that he needed to get help and change his life. I started going to therapy to help me cope with the trauma and pain that my family had gone through, and it helped me to understand that it wasn't my fault.

Now, many years later, my brother is still struggling with addiction, but my parents and I have learned how to deal with the trauma and pain that his addiction caused. We're a stronger family because of it, and while it's not always easy, we know that we can get through anything as long as we have each other.","I've been with my boyfriend, Alex, for three years now. He's my best friend, my confidant, and my rock. We've been through a lot together, including the trauma of my brother's addiction, but he's always been there for me.

Last year, Alex surprised me with the most incredible vacation I could have ever imagined. He planned a trip to Bali, a place I had always dreamed of visiting. We stayed in a luxurious resort with breathtaking views of the ocean, and Alex had arranged for a private villa with a pool. It was like something out of a fairytale.

We spent our days exploring the island, trying new foods, and immersing ourselves in the culture. Alex had booked a private tour for us to visit the local temples and markets, and we even learned how to make traditional Balinese dishes in a cooking class.

But the best part of the trip was spending time with Alex. We laughed, we talked, and we made new memories together. We watched the sunset every evening from our private pool, sipping on tropical drinks and feeling the warm breeze on our skin.

One night, Alex surprised me with a candlelit dinner on the beach. It was just the two of us, with the sound of the waves and the stars above us. He told me how much he loved me and how grateful he was to have me in his life. It was a moment I will never forget.

As our trip came to an end, I realized how lucky I was to have Alex in my life. He had planned the most amazing vacation and made sure every moment was special. He showed me how much he cared about me and reminded me that no matter what we face in life, we have each other."

This happened me with a friend of mine, which we both talked a lot both via the internet and on IRL, the thing is that, we were kinda isolated when all of the Covid stuff happened, so we tried to talk but the thing is, we changed that much, to the point that my friend and I were totally different from 3 or 4 years ago, the thing is that, he became the type of person who doesn't accept any mistakes, and he said outloud the N-word (he's white btw) and I told him it was not okay to say the N word (and worse because he shouted that, to a kinda-black friend) and he didn't accept that it was actually wrong telling me that ""it is just black humor"" and that kinda stuff, we were fighting about who was right or wrong, at the end, we stopped talking for very much 1 year or so, right now he changed and he is alright, anyways, that's the story.","I pretty much never had a conflict with someone non-significant for me, except with a teacher (this was when I was in 3rd of elementary, it has been a lot of time since then) so the thing is that she was accusing me because ""I was talking without permission"" when, at least in that whole day, I didn't talked a lot, not even in the break, so yeah, I got mad, but nothing more happened..

"Warning: Trama Dumping

I will be blunt, I have  had many conflicts with members from my family one in particular was sould crushing for me. I will try not to go into too much detail, but my older sister(A Person I adored) was a nice person(Still is) but an issue I found out was that she never liked me. 
wheither that be because of my father and my resemblance to him or because I was the youngest and was more ""Favored"". 

She hated me, she would specify this greatly although in some small verbal cases, but in others she would act like a sweet, teasing older sister. 

As I grew up I had realized how much of a mental toll it took on me with her non-verbally telling me I was hated by her. At this point had decided to send her a message about how I felt, I went straight to the point no hellos or anything. 

I was blunt, maybe I should have asked her how she was or how was life but I needed to get this off my chest.

I had sent her a few paragraphs of how I felt only for her to blame my feelingsas, Our mother putting me up to this.

It broke me,I was in a store with my parents and  was crying, knowing my older sister had said such a heartless thing and to not take in my feelings into consideration.

It was a tough an hard three days of my life, crying myself to sleep staying in an uncomfortable bed and not showering. I was scared, petrified to even move a single muscle...it was a traumatic experience.

This happened rather recently but literally yesterday I was talking to my Abuelita about how she shouldn't judge people by their appearances because even though it may not look like they're working out they may actually be trying really hard (as I am). Then I made a really unnecessary (and unwanted) comment about how she should try to work out and stop being a freaking hypocrite. We both kinda shut up for the rest of the day until my mom was pulled into it from passive aggressive comments.,Many things don't involve conflict so it's a bit weird trying to describe a memory of something random. I think the main one I can think of is one time when I was at my cousins house we were just doing a karaoke song together and in the song one of the words ahead were about to cuss. I kept trying to poke her and pause the song to tell her that it swore but as we were all egotistical as small children she didn't listen and just assumed I was trying to get her to stop singing. It was disappointed that she didn't listen and to be honest I doubt anybody remembers this day but it's been a vivid memory for me nonetheless.
"I always see my son scribbling great art work and characters. And his love for art at this age is special. Now stepping into junior college, I asked him to aim for the best design school in the world and make your passion into profession. And thats where I was shocked to learn that he is using his talent as stress buster. And for quick fame. Where as his plan is to pursue a niche profession (unpopular) and that lead me to an altercation. Now the more I show him about the design and art he goes into already listening mode. 

THis has led to increase in voice levels at many time. Even today, this subject starts off with an argument.

What I loved about this experience was how smoothly everything went. We all got along really well, and there were no major disagreements or conflicts. We were all respectful of each other's space and preferences, and we had a great time together.

One moment that stood out to me was when we went on a hike to a nearby waterfall. The hike was quite steep and challenging, but we all supported each other and made it to the top together. When we reached the waterfall, we all sat down on the rocks and admired the view in silence for a few minutes. It was a really peaceful and bonding moment, and it felt like we were all on the same wavelength.

"When I was 12, My mother had found out I had discord, my mom and dad are very protective of my safety on the internet to which younger me didn‚Äôt listen too. I made some stupid decisions and when my mother found out, she had called my dad to see what was up(they are divorced to give a bit more context). My dad looked through my stuff, talked to me and said something that will be very important for later, he told me ,‚Äù I will respect your decision if you decide not to come over here with me anymore, but you have to tell me not your mom.‚Äù So fast forward to 3 months later my mom pulls me aside and asks me, ‚Äúwhat did your dad tell you when y‚Äôall had the talk?‚Äù So I told her what he had said, and she told me that he was telling her the complete opposite, that I forcefully have to go over there wether I liked it or not because the judge said so and so on and so forth.

He ended up yelling out ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt wanna come over here anymore than just say it‚Äù so I yelled that at him crying and choking on my tears, and he said angry ‚Äúfine, but I‚Äôm not talking to you or picking you up until you talk to me or call me yourself.‚Äù  I haven‚Äôt talked to him or called him since from fear that he would try to manipulate me into wanting to stay with him and not see my mom again.

He was my idol, the person I looked up too and wanted to be like.","It would be when I would play video games with my dad and brutally loose because he was so much better than me. We would goof off hours on end, complete games, and just have fun. Or our movie nights every single night when I would go over there. Watching whatever I wanted to watch and have fun with them. Or when I would be with my cousin home alone and we would make binoculars out of cereal boxes and spy on her neighbors and having tea party‚Äôs that younger me forced her to be in because I thought they were fun and she genuinely enjoyed it too. Or a just hanging out with family members on special occasions, seeing all my favorite people in one place having fun with each other and just having a good time."
"A past conflict that I experience was a conflict between me and my friend. A friend which I was very loyal to and one of my closet friends at the time. Before the whole conflict occurred me and my friend was discussing video games which we did all the time with it usually being that or what we were working on. Then I brought up one of my favorite games which meant a lot to me. He then insulted the game which it might of meant to just be jab or just a playful insult. Personally it didn't feel like a typical playful joke or insult he would make and didn't sound like him either. Due to him insulting a game which I held very closely to me due to the game in the past providing me with motivation and joy. I made a jab at a game which he had spent a good amount of time on, and he really enjoyed the game it seemed to pissed him off as he sent a lot less of what could be a playful insult and more of a direct insult. So I told him off and I remembered a quote from a historical figure which I really enjoyed so I decide to use it for this situation. My friend then calls me extremely stubborn and annoying which I tell him why I believe he was in the wrong and he says that I am worse than someone who he didn't like to say the least. So I wrote a long explanation at the very least two paragraph on why he's in the wrong since for him to call me something like that when I had showed loyalty and a lot of support for him and just for him to say that hurt me a lot. Not really feeling to hear anymore stuff from him for a fat minute and me wanting to take a break from talking to him I temporary blocked him. ","A conflict I had with a random individual was on a server in a steam game this steam game had a decent amount of player per server. At this time it was like pretty late so I was hanging out with my friends and we were making jokes at each others expense and some guy said ""how can you be calling people nerdy when you have a half-life outfit"". So I told him that he had nerdy glasses and he shouldn't be arguing about something which he is as guilty of. Since this guy was very petty it seemed he wouldn't stop talking since he kept on following me and kept at arguing with me and his arguments were laughable bad. One of his insults that was a part of the argument was due to me having ""bad grammar"" which is a pretty bad critique in a argument that has nothing to do with spelling so I had to continue to argue and keep up with my defending my side of the story and this happened for at least around 10-30 mins intill some of my friend had to back me up and to get him to stop continuing the stupid argument and eventually he gave up. Then he said he was going to ""server hop"" and change server which he did. This was one of the more crazier past experience due to the persistent of the guy who would not let go his side of his argument.  "

Fast forward 17 years and 4 days ago & here is mny most recent conflict:

Okay so, real story. Friday I skipped AA to celebrate my dad's birthday. That was a mistake :-(. Long story short we ended up getting into a fight and he kept antagonizing me and instead of me walking away or finding a ride I stood up to him which made things a hundred times worse. He kept threatening me with jail if I didn't leave the house and I told him if he picks up the phone I will give him a reason to call the cops. He pushed me and because of the liquid devil I not only pushed back but I fucked him up real bad. He got a couple shots in and began choking me so I defended myself and busted him straight in the nose knocking him down causing blood to go everywhere. After which I felt bad and called 911. The paramedics arrived and immediately called the cops, they took him to the hospital to get stitches and they took me directly to jail. We are both being charged from the state with domestic violence currently. Not sure if this will count against my current DV from i got from fighhting him on MY Bday, but yet again not allowed at the house for one month. Just kind of winging it right now, staying a little with friends here and there...I'm off work till Saturday at the moment because they think I have covid ... getting ready to contact my lawyer now to see what he has to say.

I haven't had any outside of the occasional familial argument that any other family would usually have,I usually hand around family and watch shows on our choice of streaming service and even eat my meals with them while watching said shows
"My whole life, I was in conflict with family members. I am basically the devil's advocate at home. My opinion is always the opposite of that of the others in the family. So I was often opressed, suppressed, and yelled at, sometimes physically abused. I picked up the pattern in my life and I am trying to fix it, trying to understand that I am enough and I do not need to do a lot to impress others or satisfy them.","All I have are memories with my siblings, where we gather after dinner to clean up the table and the dishes, and the kitchen in general. We laugh, make jokes, and talk about different subjects really from different corners of the world: health, education, politics, religion, art, mental health, etc. You can hear our laughter in the whole house coming from the kitchen; those were the times we could be ourselves..."
my uncle joe raped me,i had sex with my bestfriends grandma
"background context: i'm only into girls, and was close to a friend of mine who's a guy
after hanging out for about a year, i considered him as one of my closer friends (which i didn't consider many to be). i also had been out of the closet for about 2 years at that point, which also allowed me to get closer towards guy friends since there was that mutual understanding of our friendship. story cut short, he started liking me but knew that i would never feel the same way back, and managed to convince himself to hate me instead. he started getting a lot more toxic in games and started losing his temper easily, to the point where other friends had suggested to play video games without him. he caught wind of it, and instead of focusing on the people that made the suggestion in the first place, he targeted me and sent loads of offensive messages towards me (which involved conversion therapy, sexual assault, etc.), only for him to 'apologise' the next day by threatening his safety, and premised the entire incident by saying it was my fault that he got mad. funnily enough, a few months later he texted a confession to me and with an intention to have me as his girlfriend instead of actually moving on, as if nothing ever happened xd. i don't talk to him anymore, but he still gets salty in group conversations.","i met 3 amazing friends through our school's basketball team, and despite us being in different classes and cohorts, we still managed to find ways to talk and meet up with each other, from meeting up after school, to discord calls, and going to events together! we may not talk every single day, but the times that we do it feels like we've been talking every day. they're the best thing that has ever happened in my life and i treasure them all dearly <3 we plan to go overseas together to, and i wouldn't trade them for the world :)"
"I was in an abusive relationship with my partner where he would threaten me nonstop that if I ever broke up with him he would kill himself and blame me for it, he continued to cause harm to me throughout the relationship and cheat on me but he kept the threat going. One day I couldn't handle it anymore and I fell apart, all I found that could help me communicate without speaking was my art. People started taking notice in my changes and helped me out of said relationship so he could get mental help and I could be free. ",I haven't really had many experiences that are worth mentioning in this area
"Well most of my past conflicts were with friends, rarely my family and such. One of the conflicts i most remember was when my friend group split itself into two, was not fun and one of my best friends who i will not name for privacy reasons have fought, mostly the reasons why teens fight, dumb stuff and drama and stuff inbetween those lines. ","I could say thousands of memories. Most of them would be on christmas or christmas eve due to the nature of the holiday, simple, calm, no stress and stuff."
"Some time ago, I had a conflict with a close friend about how we were managing our joint work projects. We had different ideas on how to proceed, which led to constant disagreements. The tone of our exchanges became increasingly tense and emotional, with critical remarks and judgments made towards each other.

I felt more and more frustrated and angry about the situation. This caused a rift in our friendship, and a distance was created between us for a while. It was a difficult experience, but it allowed me to better understand my communication needs and boundaries.","I remember a trip I took with my family a few years ago. We went on vacation to a small coastal town and rented a house for a week. It was a beautiful place, with lovely beaches, lush nature, and a relaxed atmosphere.

We spent a lot of time exploring the surroundings, swimming in the sea, taking walks in nature, and enjoying local cuisine. We also took the time to simply relax together, talk, play games, and laugh.

It was a very positive and enriching experience for me, as I was able to recharge and reconnect with my loved ones in a peaceful and pleasant setting. We created wonderful memories that will stay with me for a long time."""

"One instance of conflict is with one of my friends on the subject with religion. Despite us both being Christian, I was answering questions he had about my own religion since he was looking for a new church denomination to be a part of. After some exchanges, I received a difficult email where he ridiculed my religion in a large 2-page rant and ended it with an ingenuine ""enjoy your day"". I knew that at this time my emotions were quite tender, so I wrote down on paper my whole emotional feeling on the matter. Then after a day or two, I wrote a new email in response, honestly hoping that he would be able to find the church he was looking for and wishing him well on his journey. I felt that this was the best way to respond. It was a response that I would be happy to tell Christ ""yes, that is what I said"". ","Often, my opinions of my art can vary widely. In one instance when I was feeling demotivated, and unskilled to be considered ""a real artist"" I turned to several resources. 1: Healing for Digital Artists by Mao Mao, 2: a collection of compliments I have received over the years about my art, but also me as a person, how I have helped others grow and feel appreciated. 3: Artistic Stellar Ignition a 12-page PDF I created outlining the thoughts and processes I followed to achieve amazing growth in my skills and also healthier mindsets about my art. I turn to these resources and turn to people around me when I feel in these creative slumps and each time I do, I find myself spending less time being demotivated and more time being motivated."

"Had a conflict with my wife on whether or not we should move to a new bigger apartment or stay where we are. While it would give us more space, it would also cost us a few thousand dollars more a year in rent costs. Resolved by figuring out why she wanted the space and adjusting our current layout to accommodate her need for space by putting things elsewhere in the apartment. We were both happier as a result.","Once had an issue with multiple overdrafts to my bank account. I was a broke college student at the time and called customer service to see if they can't remove any of the overdraft charges. At first I tried to see if there were any loopholes into their rules because each overdraft costed me 75$ that I didn't have and I had 3. This only angered the customer service rep. However, I just broke down and said I'm new to owning a checking account and just needed a bit of help; they relented and removed two of the overdraft charges for me, saving me $150. "

"there were and still are big problems with understanding each other with family members.  we have different views on life, and their opinion boils down to the fact that I have to do everything because of what life turns into hell.

"I ended up raging in a Discord server after seeing one too many posts about a game I wanted to play but my phone couldn't support (the game in question was Pokemon Masters EX). Everyone got mad at me and so I had to leave because I felt like I was no longer welcome there (they even said it would be better without me, and I think they were right - they're probably having so much fun not being burdened by a jealous crybaby like me). I still feel bad that every time I express how I feel, I just end up hurting everyone.

"There was a period were I couldn't go to school due to financial problems, I remember this period as a very sour moment in my life, lying to my friends and getting in constant arguments with them due to those problems, the most  sickening part was how I slowly started to get more and more negative and violent responses from them as if I was the badguy or this was all my fault","A few months ago with those same friends, we reunited around october or so to hang out in person for the first time in almost a year It was very nice how everyone looked so different yet they were the same persons I met a long time ago"

"I had an informal relationship with a boy, he always insisted on formalizing what we had, but I was always clear with my feelings and what I wanted, because before I went through quite turbulent relationships. His insistence caused me anxiety attacks and he constantly punished me with his absence.

He didn't say goodbye or give me any explanation, he just punished me again with his absence. He wanted me to beg him to come back, but he was also tired, so I just had to live with the pain, after all, he made sure like the good little narcissist that he is, he had manipulated me for a long time and generated a strong bond that in the end broke.
Shortly after, I knew that he didn't care about me, he just didn't want to feel alone, because two days later he was dating someone else.","It was one day that I met some friends to go to a concert, the first big concert I went to, the group is called SIAMES.
My friends and I hadn't seen each other for a while and before going in, we took the opportunity to tell each other what we had missed during the pandemic. We played and laughed a lot and when we finally got into the concert it was beautiful.
we get very emotional and cry in our favorite song of the group, which is the most meaningful. we even kissed the 4 of us, it was fun. I felt free and I also felt that I would never be alone again, that's why I cherish those memories with great affection."

"I argued with my father for a very silly reason. He had asked me to fix the water heater and I told him that I couldn't because the pins were damaged, more than the heater, the cause would be that he was irritated. I already felt that he was very abrupt when he told me. He asked for things even a bit rude and arrogant and he had been like this for a few months until he got really rude to me so I sent him to hell and he hit me in response to which I hit him back and we continued like this for a while of good beatings obviously I got the worst part but it's not like he came out unscathed",once my father was given some wooden boards and we spent a whole day together turning those boards into beds for everyone for my mom and him for my sisters and me (we only had mattresses on the floor since we didn't have beds we were immigrants recently arrived in Ecuador) that day I learned a lot about carpentry and I also had a horrible scare when my father turned on the mower (which he had just fixed) and it shuts off halfway through a cut and he hits it a bit so that it turn it back on and then disappear it turns out that it had gone flying and landed on my father's foot he was wearing crocks and somehow the saw got stuck in the plastic and nothing happened to him

Ive always been a fighter with a hot temper. Always sticking up for myself...Im 60 years now and back in that day you didnt correct your elders under any circumstances. If one of them lied on me I would take it up with them despite what they or my parents thought. ,my father when he was alive and before he got sick was a big baseball fan and we would spend our time together watching the games and enjoying each other's company. When it came to a point to where the game could turn on a play or two being made or not made he would pace the floor like a father waiting on a newborn baby. Those were the good times

It doesn't really get extreme though so I guess it wouldn't really count as a conflict but its the most I'm going to have to say.,"I think this might be the most amount of conflict I've had with someone outside of my family. 

There was this one girl who I thought could be a possible friend at school but the thing is, it felt like I was the only one paying attention to the other and when she wouldn't help me with  a school project I just kinda unfriended her basically. Really boring I know, I apologize. I either cant remember any conflicts I had, or I'm just one of the luckiest people alive to not have real conflicts."

I stayed up fighting with him til my mom woke up and got involved, he tried to manipulate her and tell her i was lying. This event had a huge impact on my mental health which still follows me today.","When my sister was in kindergarten she was bullied by a 6th grader, I fought for her, she didnt do anything wrong. She was being a kid as you'd expect, I argued with the girl the whole time. She even tried to start a fight with me, which is when i believed that was crossing the line.

"I have a generally strenuous relationship with my family, specifically my father. I'm going to generalize for the sake of brevity, but a lot of it is to do with my elder brother being a lot more ""normal"" and having what are deemed to be useful interests and skills. Unlike him, I struggle with a multitude of health conditions, physical and mental and am someone living with disabilities, all of which he denies despite numerous formal diagnoses. Art is more or less my only skill I would consider myself capable in, which causes a lot of tension as he believes it to be a useless skill, and by extension that I am a useless person who won't survive on her own.","As stated in my previous answer, one of the few things I am confident with is creating art, which includes a long-term comic project. There have been a few bumps along the road, since I'm more or less doing it solo with no formal education or even mentor, but the past few months I've been approaching the storyboarding phase. This comic is my childhood dream, the thing I've wanted to create all my life, and I've been worried it'd be shot down or discouraged by strangers, friends and family alike. But it hasn't. My friends, both close and distant, are all generally excited and incredibly supportive, and my mother is bragging to anyone who will listen that her child is making a graphic novel. I'm used to being discouraged or even ridiculed for my passions, but that just hasn't happened here, and I'm incredibly thankful and excited about the future of this project."

I really started to like the little one and wanted to keep it. After the third time it landed in our home I asked my mother and her husband to about it . Despite it being a rather heavy decision considering our living situation they agreed to it. Something rather unusual since there usually was some kind of tension between my mother's husband and me which caused us to fight all the time. Especially since he always called me ""strange"" and dislikes my hobbies "
one time i was at florida and when i was in my hotel room i burned the carpet witch cost $1000 without thinking and i had to pay for the damage,one time me and my brothers where fighting over the best pizza toping but we calmed down and chose all of the topings!!!
"I tend to avoid conflict generally. However I remember an argument I had with a friend of mine. I recently broke up with my girlfriend (we were together for about 9 months and is to date my longest relationship) and as we're all still in our final year of college,we  sit together at the same lunch table. After I broke up with her I decided the best way to get over her would be to completely distance myself from her (I find that this usually works for me).
So for the past two and a bit weeks I've been retreating to the school library at lunch to read. My friends don't like that I do this, and as I'm fairly private usually I don't feel like explaining myself to them. 
Anyway, today one of them snapped and just started hurling insults at me and claiming that I've turned into a ""dickhead"" since breaking up with her.  And so we got into a very heated argument. It went on and on and on until I finally opened up about the relationship and why I'd ended it.
I left her because she was an awful person. She constantly reminded me of how little she cared about every aspect of my life, she deliberately ignored and stonewalled me constantly and generally made me feel useless to the point where suicide became a regular thought. I was and still am actively self harming, and the whole ordeal has changed me completely.
After this, he got quiet and pretended to care, told me how sorry he was and if he'd known what I was thinking he would never have pushed it as far as he did.
I feel, at this point that he is not a real friend. The fact that he was perfectly willing to treat me as if I was the problem for his own selfish reasons until I opened up and shared some very personal information with him, to me says he is completely disingenuous and not worth being around.
That was a lot, thank you actually, this has helped a lot.","I think some of the nicest, conflict free interactions I've had have been with my oldest friend. She's six weeks younger that me but I've known her my whole life. I hung out with her recently, not long after I broke up with my girlfriend. I hadn't seen her in ages as my ex wouldn't allow it. But genuinely, in recent months it's the nicest and most conflict free interaction I've had. We just sat, talked and listened to music for hours and it was just so nice. And because she's a girl we have different conversations, we're able to have actually good, helpful conversations because she's more understanding than all of my male friends. So that's my most recent interaction that didn't involve conflict.
Thanks for this again. It helped me, I hope it helps you."
"The only example I can think of is arguments with my sister. When we have a big argument, she can hold grudges for a long period of time",Playing video games with my friends on a Saturday night! Always makes me feel happy and loved.
"Even though, sometimes my parents and I don¬¥t agree in certain things, I wouldn¬¥t consider it conflict to begin with. Maybe some conversations and dialogues here and there, in the daily basis, that we tend to argue and discuss before eating but after that we are relaxed, full and serene again.","Well, I spend little time with my family nowadays because of college, but when I arrive home at night, when we prepare dinner, we talk and chat about our day and experiences adn tend to enjoy the rest of the night."
My friend was keeping a secret from me that involved me with it and I was kinda mad. Luckily we got over it,I dunno how to answer this question
"There have been countless conflicts between my father and I because of the nature of our relationship.  He is a narcissist.  He and I have always been in conflict.  One such conflict was my first experience with ear piercings, which my father though was inappropriate for a boy.  Little did he realize that I was trying to express my true self (as a trans human).  He is the kind of guy that would punish me for bringing any gossip or humiliation to the family.  I've never told him, or been able to tell him that I am trans, but at the time, such a little thing like jewelry seemed to bother him greatly.  He forbade me to wear such things.  I did end up wearing them anyway.  ","My ex-SO still sends me shopping sites where I can find clothing and jewelry that isn't necessarily for males nor females.  When she learned about my being trans, she was shocked but very supportive.  She's recently complimented my perfume choice."
"When I was still discovering myself in a deeper sense and figuring out my attraction to other people, my mom found out I was questioning myself and confronted me about it. My dad got involved and I had my internet access revoked and electronic devices taken away for more than a month, as well as some beatings. To this day that experience has all of us on edge with each other.","Today the little brother of a past friend got paid to do his first commission, they made sure to remember me that I was the one who inspired him to draw and taught him some things that he still uses. They asked for advice on working as an artist and it made me happy. He's like a little cousin for me."
"I get into a lot of fights with my parents, which often results with them yelling at me. sometimes they take away my door n stuff.","one time i was skateboarding and an old man told me ""good evening! i used to skateboard when i was a young boy"" and walked away."
"About a year or so ago I had to break of a friendship with someone who I'd been friends with for years. The conflict was majorly over who I was friends with as she didn't approve of some of the other people I was friends with or spoke too because she'd had bad interactions with them online. The problem was that it was somewhat of a cycle. We'd have a group of friends for around a year and then she'd get into a fight with all of them or one of them over something (it doesn't matter what to me at this point) and she'd declare them bad people and bad friends and then go on to ask me to stop interacting with them because they hurt her and it hurt her feelings for me to interact with them and I was being a bad friend essentially. For years I would wind up doing as she asked, cutting people off when she told me to, but it became too much of a pattern and I realized that this (among some other things) were creating an unhealthy environment for me within this friendship so I finally stood up to her and told her no that I wouldn't stop being friends with someone just because she didn't approve of them which led to a big argument where I was told I was cold and selfish and ""a true friend"" wouldn't talk to people who hurt her feelings and a true friend would do as she asked, etc. I tried to set up a few boundaries but the argument didn't have any true resolution. About a week later I decided to cut ties with her. ","I feel like this is a fairly broad question. 
Earlier I was playing a video game with one of my friends from college and we bantered and yelled at each other quite a lot but it was all in jest and overall it was a good time. No conflict arose. "

"My parents are a trigger for me, and more often then not there's conflict. Usually around the holidays like Christmas time. Once I hosted a Christmas get together at my house when my sister was in town from New York and they played favorites and compared us the whole time they were there. It was really annoying and caused a fight. ","Also dealing with my parents, I have been surprised lately (since 2021) there have been less and less conflicts between me an my parents and more between themselves. In January of 2021 I had a mental breakdown and my husband told them about it. Now they don't attack me like they used to. Its kinda nice, but really weird at the same time. "
I've had issues with my family not hearing me out in most situations witch when confronting them made negative conflict.,the first question was with a family member

Also feel some distance during every moment we have to work together."
I was in a pretty intense family feud after a party one night where my eldest son who is autistic was singled out by a family member. I immediately went to his defense and was met with hostility because of doing so which led to me actually fist fighting several members of my family because of thier intoxication and disbelief that I defended my son over them,Just yesterday I was at my step mothers house helping her set up a website and all of her social media accounts for her new business
"Mostly just me arguing with people in my life. Mostly my sister and grandma but we're mostly in good terms. Though my grandma likes to complain a lot which spark up some bitter feelings towards her. Though I mostly try to brush it off, said feelings would stay for the entirety of the day until I forget it the next day. I'm not sure if this counts as conflict though.","Similiar to the last one, mostly just arguments. I have a friend online that got into an argument with another person online that kept killing their oc. I won't tell the intentions behind it but take my word that it's a stupid reason. I tried defending my friend but I suck at arguing. Yet again, I'm not sure if this is counted as conflict."
"After the death of our parents, my younger brother and sister lived together for a few years.  When my sister wanted to live an independent life, my brother wouldn't let her.  A conflict developed between all three of us, which led to the fact that neither my sister nor I keep in touch with our younger brother.","I think there is no conflict when there is no interest.  There is either complete disinterest or a lack of interest.  The parties are neutral.  I can't write this about close people.  Where there is emotion, there is always some kind of conflict.  Even if the parties do not talk about it."
"I once had a friend who talked to me often. we were on the swim team together, but we always struggled with communicating when a joke had gone to far. Anyways one day she came up to me after practice and wanted to ask a question, she said that it might be offensive and I didn't need to answer if I didn't want to. I said it was fine and I promised not to get offended or mad, she wanted to know if I was autistic, I am not and told her as such. The immediate response was "" Well...are you sure?"" At this point I got a bit upset and grew more so as she started to describe that she an quite a few other people thought I ""showed a lot of symptoms"" anyway later that day she told all my friends that they shouldn't talk to me anymore.",So I went to a two week long scout camp last summer and it was a lot of fun but there was one night that still gives me goosebumps to think aboutIt was a pretty short day distance wise but it was the biggest elevation change of the tripAnd I did an awful of weight distribution in my pack causing it to pull back on my shoulders the whole dayAnyway long story short we got to the top it was hard to breathe it hurt to breathe and swallow and I was terrified but very pretty view
One experience I remember was when I was 19. I finally came out of my shell expressing myself and finally felt happy with myself.

"I had a breach of trust by my mother when she took $20,000 in increments from my bank account over a the course of a year. It was the money I set aside for taxes so not having it really put me in trouble. I did not speak to her for a month and then explained to her that it was not the money but the braking of my trust. If she needed money she could have asked me but not telling me kinda screwed me. I told her she was forgiven a year later. Its not that I‚Äôm wealthy I just put more value on people over things and money.","During a beautiful summer weekend, I went on a camping trip with two of my closest friends. We drove to a remote spot in the mountains where we set up our tent and started a fire.

We spent our days exploring the surrounding woods, hiking through the trails, and swimming in the nearby river. We also played card games, told stories, and shared lots of laughs around the campfire at night. We try to go at least once a year and it‚Äôs always a highlight of the summer."

All I‚Äôm going to say (bc this is personal) is me and my sibling had a argument over who should walk the dog.,"Hmmm, eating food?"
I mouthed off to my father because he was being aggressive and he told me to get in the corner and stuck his boot on my head.  I told him I hated him. ,"there was a rather well to do a customer who complained about not getting his paper. I went out on his delivery route afterward and personally did the route.  I checked back with him and he yelled at me that everything was fine and then he muttered ‚Äúasshole‚Äù under his breath.  then he hung up.  So because the driver quit, I had to go out and cover the route again.  So I stopped by a convenience store, loaded up on diet Pepsi, store banana bread, and a hotdog with all the fixings especially onions. By the time I got to his place all the food and drink was causing obscene gas.  I opened up his newspaper bag, just about filled it with HORRIBLE gas from those three things, and put the newspaper in.  I tied it up and stuffed it in the tube.  the gas soaked into his newspaper and he got molecules from my ass in his face.

"Relatively recently, a situation occurred in my life when my best friend, with whom we had known each other for 5 years, betrayed me. When we were 13-15 years old, we were good friends. Later, due to mental health problems, she began to use drugs, alcohol, and smoke. It was difficult enough to finish school years at the same time and do everything possible to help fight addictions, promising a good future and support, no matter what happens. She later lied about being hit by a car. For three days I was worried about her life, realizing that a coma was quite possible (She had an eating disorder and heart problems), I was looking for at least one mention in the news about a hit girl in her city, then in the region. And only three days later I was able to contact my relatives, who said that this was a lie, but everything was fine with her. A few months later she wrote to me again saying she was bored and would like to talk. But two weeks later she poured a lot of bad words on me, cursing me and saying that I am the cause of all her troubles in life, that I am the person who almost ruined her, despite all attempts to help earlier and make her happy. I tried to write to her, despite the blocking in social networks, I tried to apologize if I did something wrong. And I would never have thought that drugs can turn 2 months into 3 years (When we last talked, she wrote 8 years from the date of our acquaintance, but it should have been 5 years). I believe that while we are alive, we can change everything if we quarreled with someone. Maybe now it‚Äôs hard for me, it hurts, I feel injustice towards me, but if she is happier this way, then I agree to let the person go. If one day she needs my help, I will be ready to help her, because I promised that I would always be by her side, no matter what happens. This is very important to know for people with mental disorders. Now I'm trying to get better by doing a lot of work in the field that I love - in drawing.

(If anything, I used google translate because english is not my native language.)","During my high school years, I was bullied by my classmates. I belonged to a group of outcasts. I did not attend sections, did not know what I wanted to do in life, did not know who I was in the world. Therefore, I had a clear task to find my meaning in life. I chose the search for the meaning of life as a theme for a project during my school years. The project had to be defended in order to receive a certificate. I tried myself in different new areas, I was an instructor in a video game, preparing a group of 12 people for international competitions. I used to write poetry, I wrote short stories. When I analyzed my short life path, told about it in my project, the teacher did not understand me and ridiculed all my achievements. The teacher ridiculed everything that made me happy, which allowed me to overcome the complexes of communication with people and finally recognize the natural qualities of a leader in myself, without hiding them or abandoning them. I then burst into tears and missed several lessons of mathematics, closing myself in the toilet room. This teacher never apologized for the situation, not understanding why I was so offended and upset.

Be that as it may, the opinion of a person who does not understand the issue is clearly not worth listening to so as not to be upset, because he does not know how much work it took to literally create a personality in himself anew after everything that could traumatize me as a person, in childhood. Even if this teacher does not like my assessment project, I believe that this work motivated me to understand myself, become better and understand who I am. If not for that job, I would not have been a better coach for my dear student, who also had bad experiences with other coaches in the past. I became an exemplary coach for a student from the playing team, who did not criticize for mistakes and helped to master what seemed incredible and incomprehensible, which I am proud of to this day.

"Well, when I was about 8 years old, I had this snake plush named Gyro. It was one of those plushies that you'd get really attached to and you'd want to bring it *everywhere* So one of my friends, (Lets just call them Amanda) was playing around with Gyro during a playdate. And, you know, Amanda was a good friend of mine so I tolerated it. Unfortunately, she knocked a cup of orange juice that she was drinking over, and it got all over Gyro. I was very upset with her, and I yelled at her, she started defending herself, and yelling back, which escalated the situation even more. In the end, her parent just came to pick her up early

This was just a few weeks ago. I was sitting on my bed, reading a book called Eragon (for the 4th time), when my cat, Smudge leaped up onto the foot of my bed. Now, this was surprising for me, because Smudge is a very Anti-social cat, and usually doesn't come near any me or my family, instead, just sulking in dark corners of the house. So I resumed reading, and after a few minutes, Smudge actually came up to me and nuzzled my hand. I'm very pleased that Smudge is finally showing some affection!"

I had the kinda pinnacle of a conflict. My girlfriend broke up because she couldn't deal with my view on life. I don't like living that much and i'am not a big fan of people. It's very hard to share life with a person like that. At the moment i am trying to find out if i will stay like that and face the consequences or if i need to change. This inner conflict is fundamental but i have to solve it.,"Thats an interesting task cause it leaves tons of room to evasion... i had a great conversation with my best friend last night. We talked about my situation and we made a plan for the future. Maybe we'll move to the same city, we'll try to focus on our friendship and art. Putting the whole relationship aside might be the right thing to do now. maybe i can find peace of mind and regain stamina by concentrating on the things that i love to do. As i never gave a shit about myself, this should be the right thing to do."
"I always kept my opinions to myself. Near the end of university, I joined a group with my girlfriend whom I loved very much. Overtime I grew distrustful of said group but my girlfriend wanted to remain in it so I stayed in it with her for as long as I could. The breaking point was when I was being told what to THINK about. If I wanted to think about my girlfriend when I want then no one could stop me. I voiced my opinions to my girlfriend one night after the group meeting and for the first time in 4 years we had a big fight. She left my apartment to go home but never made it. Her scooter was hit by a speeding car at an intersection and she died. I remained in her country for 2 years after her death then gave up hope and returned to my own country. I was in her country for a total of 8 years. All I keep of her is her language and a fluffy heart she gave to me. I travelled to Spain to work and try to move on but failed. I visited a friend in Poland who tried to heal me but she failed too. I now live in Canada where I am married and have a beautiful daughter...but there are times when I am consumed with anger about something and I see her standing in front of me with tears in her eyes, hair all messed up, arms spread out to stop me from advancing toward whatever is the object of my wrath.
Now, I keep my opinions to myself and speak when spoken to.","I got married to my wife. She has dark skin and black curly hair so it is often a trait of characters in the art I create.

"Mostly the usual arguing in the relationship, on small things. ","After 30 years, I‚Äôve got a very kind, true letter from my mom to my birthday, which I always want to."
"Me and my mother have always had a rocky relationship with their being multiple occasions in which she verbally abused me for stupid things like hiding my phone from her, or being on it at night But the most memorable one would probably be the one that result in physical violence between both me and her. I had gotten into a stupid fight me not want to do my homework and instead of trying to rationalize with my mom I would just laugh at her under my breath. As she started to notice this she would slap me, which for her wasn‚Äôt unusual, but for some reason when she slapped me I broke and hit her back causing us fist fight to the point where I was in the ground off my closet with her on top of me. She would repeatedly smack me up and down the head while cursing me out. When she stopped she walked out of my room with little to no feelings of remorse. A couple of minutes later I had started to feel bad so I went to apologize hoping I would get the same back but instead she just continued to guilt Tripp me saying things like ‚Äúdo you even see what your done to me‚Äù while pointing to the scratch marks I had given her( which I already felt bad about). Days later and we kinda just forgot about it, and I try to avoid think about it since I truly do love my mom with my whole heart.","I‚Äôve never really had big issues with friends, but I know this on definitely hurt me. When I was around nine I had started going through puberty with the basics, like arm hair and chest growth. Because I had started so much earlier than all my friends I felt like the outcast constantly hiding my body. One of those friends would make it substantially worse by repeatedly making fun of me for said things. Examples of this being her saying things like ‚Äúoh look at you with your giant boobies‚Äù and ‚Äúok fatty thighs‚Äù just making my view of myself worse than it was. And my family was supper close with hers so I would constantly see her, being unable to escape. As we grew older we distanced ourselves from and each other and I regained my self love and respect."
"Welp, this is quite emotional. I never had a good relationship with my dad. In 2018, long story short, I was suffering from depression. April before easter, in the evening, we were in the living room, I was on the computer while my mum was watching tv and he came downstairs with a pile of laundry, putting it on the floor. My memory is kind of fuzzy but I remember feeling really annoyed that he wouldn't stop complaining and moaning. In anger, I slammed my laptop keyboard and screamed ""SHUT UP!! JUST SHUT UP!!"" I never ever stood up to him like that before, to this day I feel really proud of that, after I screamed that, I was really shaken up as I was always quiet and didn't raise my voice. Anyway, of course, he got mad and shouted at me. I remember him saying that he didn't say anything to me during that (as in, there was no reason for me to scream at him like that). One of the things I remember him saying was that his life is so hard, with work, taking care of us and all that, making me feel guilty, and that I never talk to him. One of the things I remember saying things like how I was so fed up of him constantly getting angry and being horrible to me, with things like me mainly being clumsy with my drinks-spilling them, my dad would basically get upset so easily. I remember the arguing made me as not only was I upset, but also shaking and losing my energy-slowly passing out. He noticed this and gave me drink of water. My mum comforted me, then he went upstairs, probably being upset. Can't remember what happened the next day, though I remember I stopped talking to him, then after some time we talked again. Still to this day, he's still a nuisance, I still don't talk to him coz you have to be careful what you say to him. My mum had the same trouble as me. We both moved out to live somewhere else so me and my mum could get freedom from his controlling and unbearable behaviour","Don't know what answer to give but here's a story involving me and my friend. In 2021, I started college and met a girl I have really liked hanging out with. Out of all the friends, she's been the best one I've ever had. Though at times I found it hard to be around her. We were both in one art class. Long story short, I didn't know whether to do level 1 or level 2 so I picked level 2, I think because I wanted to get into a higher level, that was before I met my friend. My friend was in level 1 so she was a grade below me. I felt like I made a mistake because I wanted to be in the same level as her. In my level 1+2 art class last year, most of the time I hung out with her and really enjoyed it. This year, since I am at level 3, I had to be moved to a level 3 class (which is separate), she does level 2 now in the level 1+2 art class. Me and her both said that we feel lonely and got no one else in our classes. So we mainly got each other, we would mostly text or I would walk with her while we were our way to our classes :)"
"Here one from life. Although it's not a direct conflict, it's still a case. When a mother passed by with her two daughters (I had known them for a long time), I said hello and asked how they were doing. And they started to say, ""And how are you doing?"", ""Where are you going?"" and things like that. They tried to dodge the question, and they did. I think that when people don't want to tell each other their personal affairs and problems, it's not a real friendship.","There was such a thing at school. When later one of the students approached me and asked for an autograph (they say, I sing well), I had suspicions of his sincerity and honesty. Because my class as a whole is joking with a friend to friend all the time. And when the next time I asked him for an autograph, he did not object, but suggested that, they say, he did everything seriously. Although I didn‚Äôt make an conflict, I still don‚Äôt believe in this ""honesty""."

"i guess what i'll say here is what i can call a conflict. in general, i'm a really forgiving person, and i usually ignore things that bother me in someones behaviour. once, i got falsely accussed of bullying. i denied but not everyone believed me, even though no one had any proof of me doing such things. the person who started the rumour was my friend. i confronted them and i tried to stay as calm as possible. well, later the pressure between us became bigger and bigger, and then we fought in front of other people in public. but now, we moved on. this experience hurt me but we all are people who make mistakes.","i don't think i had one that could possibly affect me, at least i didn't memorize any"

"I've been under an enormous amount of stress lately as we had our test phase in my university. Taking care of all the household duties kind of caused a lot of friction with my family members as I felt that they didn't really consider how time consuming it was for me to make sure every chore was done. I then voiced out that I felt like they take my time for granted and didn't really value how much I actually do. So then I stopped doing the chores for about two days and got called out for it. My parents especially told me that everyone had to do their share and it caused us to fight. I then left home to have some distance for a week and stayed with a friend. When I felt the time was right, I returned home and we talked about it. I'm not confident it'll change anything, but at least they now try to consider how I feel too. ",I can't really answer that question because it's too general. I don't cause conflicts if they're not based on something.

"I'm not sure if this conflict is meaning more mental/verbal conflict or physical. If mental/verbal conflict/abuse counts, then my mother takes the cake, however the conflicts I have with her are random, often, yet sometimes minimal and sometimes more. Our most recent conflict came from my mother purchasing a THC Delta 8 edible that she knows -nothing- about. She claims someone she talks to on Facebook told her to try it for her nerves. I'm not sure how much I believe that statement, but she does talk to random ""men"", and I give quotes to that due to them appearing as men, but it's usually those scammer people and my mother is unfortunately at the age that she thinks these people are ""into"" her(even though she's married and well taken care of), but they're just there for their own gain. Anyways, she ate more than she should have of the edible and it conflicted with a medication that she's on and she ended up in the hospital with stroke-like symptoms. I was unaware she had even purchased the edible until after she got to come home a couple days later and she gave the rest of the edible to me when my father wasn't around(I partake, but I know how much I can/cannot handle) because she took it without him knowing. So he had NO idea that she basically cost him money for her dumb decision. I was so frustrated and upset with her but did not really confront her until about a week later when she came to my house randomly(we don't get along often) and she started trying to bring up things I did in my past as a teen and young adult. I reminded her we aren't talking about me and to stop deflecting things she's doing onto me. I'm sparing the details, but it was very upsetting for her to yell at me for something she did, attempting to make me feel guilt. I ended up telling my father about it a few days later since I couldn't get through to her. I know that might not sound like the conflict of verbal/mental abuse she gives me, but it's the most recent big issue we've had. We always argue and she is literally the one starting it every time, so I actively avoid her if I can.","Today is actually my mothers 69th birthday. I gave her a plush Minnie Mouse & Mickey Mouse, flowers and a card that told her that she's an amazing mother, even though I don't agree with that statement, she's still my mother, she's the only one I'll ever get and I still love her. We had a good evening giving her gifts and cards and eating cupcakes. Days like this are the ones that I wish happened every day."
"Almost every day. my dad and I don't get along as well as we used to... I always have issues with school and just everyday-duties and/or chores, and my dad gets aggravated easily. my mom isn't home much, so she doesn't witness much arguments. ",I don't have any 'friends' or significant others.
"I live in Russia. I have a brother. As soon as Perestroika began, he went into business, before that it was impossible to do this with us. We in the family were delighted and began to help him. This went on for many years and we hoped that our common successes would bring us money and prosperity, before that we lived very poorly. But my brother understood the word business in his own way. He graduated from college, got married, moved us from our apartment to another, worse one, bought a pedigree for a non-existent German grandmother, sold the business, passed a German language proficiency test and left for Germany with his wife as a German, not being one. We thought that entrepreneurs deceive everyone except the family, but they were mistaken, they start with their family, and then deceive the rest. Laughter. Why am I laughing? Deceiving a loved one is the most terrible thing in life, everything that happens now in fascist Russia is no longer scary to me.","I want to describe the experience of my first love. I was very young and she was also young, about twenty years old. We worked together and were both artists. Can you imagine a guy and a girl together in a closed room for eight hours every day? We liked each other and besides work began to have sex, every day several times. Tell me more? Some other time. We didn't get married, I think because men at that age aren't ready to start a family yet. I often think about it and probably regret it."

"Growing up in high school, I spent a lot of my time by myself creating and crafting when I wasn‚Äôt in school due to my parents obsessive alcohol abuse, living at home was scaring sometimes and I would do whatever I could to avoid that conflict at home (extracurriculars, sports, going out) but one way I new I could avoid that confrontation and discomfort (and sometimes danger) was through finding a safe hideaway and making work for myself, almost a separate world for my own expression, manifested onto paper, or device. As much as it was such defining part of my life in the sense that my parents directly affected my home life, the ability to seek solace became a skill I really developed within my art, not only serving as a talent, but rather a protective device. ","Winter season of 2022, I had finally found a moment to breathe and get away from the insanity of New York‚Äôs bustling hustle lifestyle and go visit family. During that time I found myself drawing much more thanks to the copious amount of hours I had not working myself to death. Thus I chose to work myself to death in another art form and sell commissions. I had connected with so many individuals in a deeper way than I had ever before; drawing gifts, meeting people that were considered superstars where they are from, designing stories within tattoos, gifting people reminders of people they had loved and lost. I was commissioned by a contractor to design a portrait of a lighting designer and his late wife who he had lost two years prior. I am lucky to have met this lighting designer and not only get to learn about him, work with him in different capacities, But bring about the wonder of memory. It was a great reminder that the past can be something cherished, we as humans tend to give it such a gruesome demeanor, but the past includes such truthful exuberant portions of ourselves and our love for others, we can love those moments after we have mourned their passings.

That my mother passed away ,Fighting 
"Quite recently I (I will try to write everything in the order of our conversation.) quarreled with a friend because of a misunderstanding and we started talking about it. She said that she didn‚Äôt like it, that she trusted me (I wrote her desire to our common friendly group.) And I did so, to which I asked her why she should trust the person she hates before, to which she told me that she had such a period in which something constantly infuriates her, something is sad, etc. after that she wrote that she was the victim of another person (who has nothing to do with it.) in the first grade, after which I said that she drove me away, showed an indecent gesture and cursed at me. After she started talking about lockers, I asked why she answered me that we began to quarrel after six months of their appearance, then she jumped off the topic saying that she herself understands how other people can think like me, why she behaves this way. After that, I wrote that I was disgusted to talk to her. She says that for that she is pleased when she is told the truth, and also that she does not know how to hate, etc. but just imitates.
This is only part of our quarrel, but I think there is a lot of it. Also today we kind of measured. after my conversation with her mother, she asked what happened to her, to which I answered her ""we had a quarrel. A very serious quarrel."" and she asked me to go to school with her. I agreed. At the meeting, we just measured. It seems to be.","My best friends and I have a group where we chat and joke and try to get two of our friends married, make all kinds of stickers and just be ourselves. By the way, since we started talking about the wedding, a few months ago I was talking with a friend and thought about who could marry whom. And we talked about those two friends and we had a ""brilliant"" plan for their wedding. She made fake marriage certificates and I tried to make them believe they were getting married. 
This is at least what I remember. Now the group is very quiet, one might say extremely calm, which is extremely unnatural."

"My last big conflict was quite a long time ago with my friend. We had a project in pairs, where we shared responsibilities with her to perform. The project was given a month, I completed my part quickly and began to wait for the rest from a friend. The day before the presentation of the project, I wrote to her, asking where her part was (we needed to combine everything into one big work). She unexpectedly replied that she thought we had two more weeks (I reminded her about this almost every day, that the end of the project was coming soon). That's where the conflict happened, because I understood that she was too lazy to do her part and she postponed everything until the last day (then it was confirmed). Well... This was the moment where I was furious with another person. 
P.S. we passed the project perfectly.","I didn't have any big conflicts with someone else. I can only say about the situation with the teacher due to a misunderstanding, but it was resolved quickly."

"This happened when I was young (this inspired quite a bit of my art), I had lots of fights with my parents. They disagreed with lots of subjects that I agreed with, they had different approaches to things which were harsher and most of the time, caused more drama. I was arguing with my father about how I enjoyed art and wanted to pursue it but he said it was stupid. It did hurt a lot yet, this gave me more encouragement to continue making art. Change his mind in a sense.","This was with a past girlfriend of mine, she adored my art and loved it lots. She always said how peaceful I looked when I drew, which I never understood, I was just trying to sketch.

"I have so many conflict in my family but this is the most standout. I am the third child from four siblings. I am the only male in that family. My oldest sister already married. Her husband is the biggest scumbag (called him D). D is abusive and manipulative bastard. My sister is so blind and insist marrying him. She has a child from their marriage. One day, I got a call from my second oldest sister, she said that i had to go home immediately. When I arrived, my oldest sister was crying hysterically. My second oldest sister told me that D kidnapped their child and vanished. We searched D and finally found him from his sister's ig account. D was in the hotel in another city. Me, mom, my oldest sister, and my second oldest sister flew to to the hotel to find D. We found D with the child. But he refused to return the child, he said that my oldest sister mental is not good for raising a child. My oldest sister's mental state is in borderline of being crazy. But it is bcs he took her child! So we argued back and forth with D and his family. Surprisingly, all D's family support D's decision, they all in kahoot kidnapping the child. The argument heated, D's father throw glasses at me and injuring my hand. D and my eldest sister finally chose to compremise. D demand many unreasonable things from my sister for her to get her child. He wanted my sister to give him share of my oldest sister's business (which she inherited from our late father) and demand her to become a trad wife (she can't work, have to cook and clean the house). But my oldest sister is perfectly fine become working mother, she didn't neglect her child! D is the bad father, he rarely home and have time with his child. And yet, my sister accept the term, even though we discouraged her. I thought it was over, but in the early morning, a receptionist called us and said that D is running away AGAIN.
My second eldest sister borrowed hotel employee's motorcycle, and I also went along. We chase after D who is in taxi with the child. He went to train station! My sister has to stop in front of station. I jumped and chase after D. I managed to stop him. It was chaotic event and my niece has been crying all the time and ppl staring at us.
Long story short, my oldest sister finally get her baby, she divorced her husband and sue him. D went to jail.

Not so long ago, it was all cleared from gigantic trees which were growing there for decades. Only the pines were left.

Getting hit by a parent,Getting my art review by my aunt
"when i was about fourteen me and my mother were fighting over nothing every day. I started spiraling into depression and my grades started getting lower. I based my identity a lot in the fact that i could easily achieve excellent results, so my self esteem toook a blow. My friends already drew at the time and i started because of them. Because of my mom's constant criticism and my growing obsession with oerfection i reacted very badly to any comment or advice from them. My art was very dark, as i had more suicidal thoughts i started drawing people hanged or hanging themselves, more grotesque things, small comics on suicide and sadness, sad characters, music based vent art, etc. I developed a lot of cepticism and distrust, and a sarcasm not even my mom could respond to. I don't really remember those times, but it stayed until today. I have made my brother cry with it and it wasn't even intentional. That perfectionism from befora also stopped and stil stops me from getting out of my comfort zone and sometimes i can't even draw at all because of itg. That goes on to this dat. Me and my mother are in better terms now, but none of the characters i make that are an extention of myself as a mother. Maybe due to my depression, most of the characters i draw and i intend to make with a neutral face look sad or angry. My reactions were fully suppressed during the emotional trauma, at one point i stopped talking back completely, pushing everything down with a neutral face. My characters also do that. Whenever i make them angry they still look... kinda like theyre not. i give them a lot of restraint and make them bottle up. but when i make them explode, they explode for real","I was born what people consider a smart person and was treated as such. I was taught to see myself as smarter than everyone around me. Thata what i based my identity on since i was a chils, so nobody could ever know when i was wrong and i could not let anybody have better results than me. That shows in my drawing style in traditional mediums with an attempt at clean, perfect lines, and in all, lack of expression in characters that are supposed to be beautiful not to ruin their faces, fear or ever trying new things, poses too static for being afraid to fail on making them better, etc. "
"I have been in plenty of toxic relationships, including Opinion Bashing with Family, A toxic Ex-Boyfriend who never took the blame for what he did, and Friends who only used me for my talent.",I had Major Anxiety and Depression episodes that caused Suicidal Thoughts and that sent me to multiple mental hospitals. I am currently in therapy and are working out these issues.
"My mom and i had a problem with my grandma some years ago, I was talking about a dream i had last night and my grandma just complained about me because ""I talk too much"", my mom told her to let me talk because she always interrupts me and then complain bc i don't speak, so she got angry and started yellling my mom. My mom got angry too and told me to go home (we literally live in front of my grandma's house), it made my grandma even more angry so they started arguing about a lot of other problems, i went to my room and had a panic attack, then i heard my grandma was hiting my mom so i came back to her home to stop her, she almost threw me a glass and yelled it's all my fault. Then my aunt (it's our neighbor too) tried to calm down the situation and gave my grandma a glass of water but she throw it to me. My mom and i took a bus and just went outside.    ",Most of those experiences are just discussions about specific topics or just conversations about our day.
"Hello! Thank you for the opportunity to answer the requested questions.
My name is Johnny, I'm 35 years old, I live in Brazil, I live in a community of extreme violence where socially vulnerable people, drug users, drug dealers, bandits live together.
When I was little I have memories of people who were murdered, after the shootings, my father would take me to see people, they were horrible things that I saw involving blood and death that are kept in my memory with a lot of pain.
My father and mother separate over the years they had many fights, which involved a police case. In my school life, I was never a good student, not because I was bad, but because my parents didn't invest and encourage me in more qualified studies, they didn't have a lot of financial resources, because I was black I suffered a lot of discrimination at school, many Sometimes I went to the board for fights. It wasn't bad, I just didn't have good guidance on how to proceed, I have many traumas linked to the extreme violence on the part of the country I live in, Brazil, and the police force that oppressed black citizens like me.
I've always been a hard worker, I worked in a market. I always liked art, but here in Brazil art is not valued, and those who are poor cannot afford to study art. At school I was always a good student in the arts, in other subjects I always got low grades.
Over the years working in the market and studying at a private college paying a lot of suffering, I managed to pay for the course and attended two colleges, one of history and the other of Portuguese Languages, I am a trained teacher, however I never taught, as there are not many job opportunities . At the moment I find myself unemployed. With depression and anxiety due to many things that happened. Sometimes drawing is good, because it gives hope for something that doesn't exist. Real life is very painful. I draw because I like it, maybe if I had been born in Paris, or in another country, I could have better opportunities to develop in art or another profession and have a better quality of life. Maybe I stayed for another life, another existence. For this is loaded with pain and suffering. For now I survive I hope one day to live if not in this life, who knows after it. I wish happiness to all who suffer and who can be loved!Viol√™ncia domestica

One night, my mother was sleeping next to her and I saw people who emanated a very strong light that enveloped me.
They were beside her looking on with a look of tenderness and affection. That light enveloped me. And it made me realize when life is so short and many things are not worth it.
As Socrates says about the importance of preparing to die during your life, before drinking the hemlock."
"I seldomly have conflicts, given that I am mostly able to identify the interests behind the persons behaviour and given that I seek to communicate in a non-violent way. ","Yesterday night we had a party with good music, which caused everyone to feel more united and to share the positive energy stemming from the music. "
"Hmm, I don't remember much bout my past at the moment but I do remember I have a few friends that helped me get through school and education.  My family thou, they have been getting better themselves throughout the years than they were in the past. My parents used to abuse me and my siblings a lot when we were kids and teenagers but now they don't, as long as we don't do anything super bad and I am an adult now. Recently, I have had a very complicated relationship with my significant other and we are in a long-distance relationship for a year. I'm not sure of our relationship status at the moment because his mother told me I am no longer part of his life but then he said it's not over yet and he can't talk to me due to his mother didn't allow him to. It's been three weeks now, and I have been managing it well. Sure I did want to feel like dying at first when I found out bout it but I have been doing well lately. They maybe are giving me a lot of pain my life sometimes but then again somehow I managed to see the beauty in life although not for that long.","This is hard to remember but I guess my life didn't start with a good one from what I can remember. I often would get bullied at my school when I was a kid, I still remember three kids pushing me down onto the floor, locking me in the room for a couple of mins, or what it felt like, smudging some red ink pen on my hand while I was asleep (trynna make it look like blood) and even some mean words that ruined my self-esteem. I had to go through those for years until I turned 13. I tried to change everything to not get bullied ever again by talking to other kids and not potentially looking like the next victim of the bullies. I mean I did make some friends, some ended up being a bully, and others ended up being former friends after 4 years. I've been trying to get somewhere or anything to boost my mental strength so I can deal with more negativity in the future and can be mentally prepared but I know that I won't ever be strong because of the beyond-damaged mental I have. I have always been dealing with my mental issue alone, despite my big sister getting help because she got a mental issue from this family, they thought I'm fine and good. That I do not have any mental issues at all. This life is kinda too much for me tbh, I lost three relatives in my life and the pressure from everyone they are giving me is unbearable."

A discussion with a friend about a topic where they did not understood what exactly I was saying and they just did not understood my opinion,"I went to a friend's house for a week last summer, we went outside, played some video games, drunk alcohol, all in all we had a great time together "
"I have always been a very calm and peaceful person, I don't usually get into conflicts and I prefer to solve problems with dialogue than with unnecessary fights.  My family is similar to me in that sense, so it's hard to describe a conflicting scene within my family. 
","But if there is a conflict as such, I prefer to resolve it by talking or simply avoid it.  I don't usually warm my head very much with this type of situation.  Rather, I have always been of the idea of: ""that others warm their heads arguing and fighting over nonsense, while I live my life as I want"" and that's it. On the other hand, art in general has been very important to me, especially music and illustration."
"Used to have a significant other I'll call bomy, he wasn't a very good person, very manipulative, typically high or drunk, treated me like a punching bag in the way of my emotional state. We ""dated"" for four years, and in those four years he failed to tell me he had bpd, antisocial personality disorder, and that he had basically been diagnosed as a sociopath, so I was treated with the worst treatment possible from him. I left him after meeting my current boyfriend. ","Contrary to my last answer, my current boyfriend is, amazing. He treats me with respect, comes to me when he feels low and lets me do the same, we play videogames constantly and I draw us together almost all the time. I'm happier than I've ever been. "

"I have not had such big conflicts since I am usually very quiet, if anything I have had conflicts, they are with my cousins ‚Äã‚Äãfor silly reasons that have affected me","For example, when we are organizing an event, the family tends to disagree on certain things, but we don't argue."
While I do not want to talk to a stranger about my experiences I will say and there have been several fights in my household and drawing has helped me to feel better afterwards.,Anytime I have conflicts with anyone art usually helps me to calm down and take my mind off what has happened
"A friend and I had a bit of a falling out a few years back. We had only known each other for less than six months but became really close friends rather quickly. I guess you could say we ""clicked"". 
We'd share personal matters and talk about whatever for hours on end. Our interests were very similar as well, I remember another friend of mine described us as being almost exact copies of each other. I thought it was the start of a long and beautiful friendship. 
However, thanks to miscommunication on my end we started drifting apart. Long story short, while I was good at listening and being there for them, I never made any of my thoughts known. Always kept to myself. 
We slowly stopped talking and after a failed attempt at salvaging our friendship, we went our separate ways.
 ","I'm realizing I don't have a lot of conflict in my life. But for the sake of answering the question, last year I, and a handful of other classmates, had an issue with one of my teachers. 
When you go to college for the first time, there's a higher degree of difficulty that's expected. Harder subjects, more responsibilities, and a whole lot of studying. It can be difficult at first but you eventually get used to it.
The same goes for teachers, some will be laid back and ""easy"", and others will be very demanding and strict in their ways of teaching. 
This teacher was the latter. Very demanding! Expected only the best from us, which I can understand. Sometimes being hard on your students is for their own good. 
But there's a point where she went from being a ""hard-ass"" to just being spiteful.
To keep it short, one of our classmates unjustly got a failing grade because he told her to stop treating us like crap. Maybe not the best way of saying it but the sentiment was true with everyone. We as a group tried to help him out and reported her but she didn't really get in trouble.

"It's really a funny story, I was about nine at the time and I have elderly retired disabled parents. The thing about old people was they got sick and quite easily, so back then my father got sick and everyone in my family was distressed.

I'm not a hard-worker by fault, neither is my sister. Yet as the youngest, when it all came down to it... My whole family blamed me! I have an older sister and a mother, both berated me for the two weeks my father was sick, even including him, who said the world was spinning in his eyes and it all hurt so much. It was really awful. His entire face was flushed red as he yelled at me for about ten minutes before groaning.

My mom and sister who are very alike, I never expected it, but I guess I also did. My older sister destroyed and disposed of all my things while occupying the living room for as long my dad was sick, blasting music, giggling with her friends on video call, playing minecraft, and pretty much just degrading my any time I stepped out of the room. Calling me things like useless, stupid, and a person who couldn't do anything right. Even going as far as to calling me crazy and telling me I should die.

My mom didn't cook for the two week period my dad was sick except for my dad and herself, and when she did she boiled spaghetti and served it after cooking for five minutes... Which frankly hurt my teeth LOL! No groceries were bought either. It's not that important, but I felt really sad making my own sandwiches and having my mother cry and yell it was my fault while I ate. My dad as ear issues, so the crystals were messed up, I also did not do anything to cause it. He also got a heat-stroke to add onto things, it was mid-Summer.

I wanted to run away, and although they still agree it was all my fault, I think it's the past. My older sister is truly a sociopath in my opinion with how much she bullied me at the time, and she always laughed while her eyes sparkled at my grief. It only makes sense since she's been calling me fat since I was like, three, and an ugly girl even now. Seriously!!! >:(

Anyways it was a really cornered experience, I'm cowardly by nature, but that definitely was one of the worst to recount by far! They've definitely toned down since now though my sister is the same, but no matter how I go about addressing my feelings, they still say it was my fault... LOL. If only they could explain to me how?!?!","I think it was my eighth birthday, I hugged my parents and jumped on the airbed with them in the living room and watched ninja turtles with them for HOURS that morning. We all talked about the show and I can't remember much about it, but the vibes that day were awesome!"
"The day I appeared in the principal's office with erratic behavior. It affected my classmates and my mother. At that time, I was blinded by jealousy, not knowing what to do. The teachers just told me how they would change me by talking to me or lecturing me. It couldn't switch on how I am that they all wanted. Even with my own struggles, everything can take time. It took years to change and control my behavior before achieving the peace I needed.","
I guess my grades. I am the one who is most affected by poor academic performance. My parents can scold me, but the guilt stays inside me and doesn't affect anyone."
"As much as I don't really care for this story I'll tell it.
This was back when I was about 6 years old and my Dad had just met my mother, who had 2 daughters of her own already. Before I met her and my sisters I was an only child and I didn't take change well and I had a hard time adjusting to new people. I was eager to make new friends, yes, but i didn't like the idea of a new mother, and i thought she would take my dad from me. (though my bio mom died when i was 2, i was very attached to my dad) I wish to come clean though, I was a bad kid. I was very stubborn about letting her come into my life because i thought my life was fine.(and i had already gone through this sort of thing before her) I was rather rude and harsh towards her despite her only showing me care and love. i also didn't get along with her daughters. One day her older daughter (name will not be told) and i got into a really bad argument, and i mean bad. Though I can't remember what it was over, I do remember threatening her, eventually it turned into her chasing me through their house with a metal ice cream scooper, when i hid behind a gate that barricaded the island in the kitchen (which was built so there dogs couldn't get to the front door) when i locked the gate, she flailed the scooper in her hand over the gate and it slipped out of her hand. It hit me in the head, and i just stood there in shock. When their mom came out of her room to check, she yelled. She sat me up on the kitchen counter and was panicking, I remember being so calm about the whole thing as she panicked, sitting there and telling her i was fine. she rushed me to the emergency room and i had to get stitches.
I never got the hint though, it took me until after 4 years or so of them being together to realize that my life wasn't perfect, and that my dad wasn't happy. I realized that that woman... actually cared about me, which hurt me to realize how long i was wrong about her, and though it took me a little longer to call her my mother, I remember the day of their wedding when i cried, i had finally realized that I had a mother, someone besides my dad to give me comfort when he wasn't around, someone who i could tell my sorrows and pain to. I still fight with her now, but I know it's because she sees potential in me, and that she cares about me. And that older sister who hit me with the spoon? they're now my best friend and my biggest fan. my older sister gave me what i needed, that i had lost from my brother; an older sibling to tell me that im doing good, and i can be whoever i want if i try. i cherish them for that...","I could probably tell countless stories of my family and how they helped me to be who I am today. The biggest example of that would be my younger sister, though she was only a year younger than me and in the same grade as me, she was a lot like an older one..or like a second mom :)
I remember coming home late after a football game (i'm a band member) and going to sleep, crying. She knew something was wrong, and though i didn't want to talk to her, i eventually did. At first i yelled for her to leave me alone and instead of her yelling back, throwing the same negative feedback, she knew it wasn't going to help. soon it turned into me spilling everything about what happened to her and then the 2 of us laughing about how much we ""hate"" each other yet we understand each other and she was really good at telling what was wrong. though i would tell this sort of thing to my mom, my sister is the one who noticed that i was upset, because i didn't like to tell people my emotions. me and my sister can practically read each other's minds. she could say ""you know?"" and i could tell exactly what she meant without words. she talked to me till about 12:00 pm and told me to get rest, taking my ice cream and throwing it away and turning out my lights for me.
I won't ever forget her for that..."
Hmmmmmm well its just about my ego being a dick to everyone in my family ,"Money, school , my hobbies "
"Well, I could write you a novel, I was in 23 different foster homes before the age of three.  Then adopted by the last set of fosters, who used me as a scapegoat for their natural kids.  Physical, psychological and sexual I dealt with on the daily.  Hell, when they died a couple of years back, the will stated you are not our blood child and wrote me out of the will.  So you could suffice it to say I have had daily trauma as a youth.","Wow, a positive experience from my family, I lettered n several spots they never came to a game, they threw me into a boarding school, so they could travel, I woke up from being gang raped by 4 at 15 while still a virgin and was told there would be less shame if I had died now I was an embarrassment to them.  HRM, Positive, maybe the time I started to self harm at 11 and begged to get a therapist and was told mental health is junk science just wear long sleeves.   So on that note.  Nah, I really cannot think of anything positive growing up. Sorry, it's totally not your fault I am so reactive and cynical dealing with my supposed family and my youth."
"Well, in summary my biological father was a drug addict, he beat my mother and with my help we put him in jail. I had a stepfather who played with my mother so to speak, my current father although he is an amazing father is a drunk who brings out the worst when he drinks and I was raped by a teacher.",I adopted a beautiful girl and since then I have wanted to live. It's not like I was thinking of committing suicide or anything like that. But I'm glad to be alive just for her. And that grew when I had my son.
"My brother was drunk and started beating my dad, not bad, for something between him and my mom that happened a long time ago..I tried to step in..",Me and my mom always used to go to dinner during the week at a casino and always had a good time.. Both her and my dad passed in 2018.. 
My friend had an argument with me and she killed herself because of it.,My ex told me to kill myself because I was venting to him.
"Yes family, mainly an over bearing mother. Did not approve of my fiancee and as a result when we married, she refused to attend the wedding, when we traveled 2000km to visit on our honeymoon, she was too sick to travel 50kms to meet us. A few years later when we moved to near them, she ensured the family ignored us, treated my wife like trash making us feel unworthy, ashamed and ready to leave. Took four years to save the money to move back south in which time her hatred almost destroyed our marriage. Thirty three years later that horrid time has left a mark on my wife and I as she regards that time as a living hell and her only friends were a neighbour and the people she met at nightclubs and parties she went to. Still to this day at parties or clubs, she goes her way to meet with her friends and I meet up with a few mates. The stress lead to me getting kidney cancer, lost one and heart problems.
","Met a friend at a club meeting, she was a new member some forty two years back. Interesting girl from the snow country. Amazingly hard life, struck up a friendship that lead to many happy years and we married, forty years almost and still together, growing old disgracefully together with our kids.."
In your whole life you can't assert that all your thoughts will meet with others or vice versa. But... conflict means is not that you don't love or care about your love once or vice versa.,"Although there might be conflict on some matter, your love once will always stand to care about you it's a true and pure relationship "
"Well I've had a few conflicts here and there but to be honest, I've tried to resolve these issues as much as I can since I'd rather have left them in good terms since living a life of hatting someone, it just makes life bitter and it starts to hurt the people that surounds you.","well the one experience that always comes to mind, is hanging out with my best friend at his house watching the superbowl, or at least try to, we'd end up playing Pokemon tcg and talking about are day since we rarely are able to visit eachother since we live in the corners of the city to even end off the day we drink arizona tea and that's me one of best expirences that I like :)"
My father always critically relate to my art. One day he even said me to be ashamed to write my name on it.,"Not so long ago i`ve started to draw portraits in oil of my colleagues for prizent on birthdays. That was to free. And still im a little ashamed of my portrait level but they dont look at a given horse's teeth. 
ps sorry for late mb just read your message."
"At one point, I got into a squall with my sister over her condition. (I won't say for her privacy) She didn't respond to me constantly and I became very frustrated with her. Finally it broke out to an argument with her and it didn't end well. After some time though I finally understood what she was going though. I still come in conflict with her at times still but not 
as bad as it used to be.","My manager (I used to work at a supermarket) had little experience with her job so often  came into conflict with her over several things on how a certain process worked and the like. One day though, I started a argument over something I can't recall now but things got ugly. In the end I came out of it dismissed for the day feeling vindicated. Looking back now I realize that I shouldn't have let my feelings get away with me. Things might have been better if I hadn't let my anger get to me."
"I was never allowed to actively express myself with my hair because of my mother and grandmother's religion. I wanted it very short so I could actually take care of it but I was never allowed to cut it. It hindered my personal growth, confidence, decision-making skills, and social life.",My former English teacher gaslit the entire class because she gave out wrong directions for a presentation assignment.
"It was pretty difficult to think of this scenario, as I don't get into conflict at all, really. However, I suppose a conflict that I experienced was with a friend of mine. The conflict consisted of him constantly leaving comments on my art hating on one of my characters. I knew he meant these things jokingly, but the comments still annoyed me as those were the only comments he would really post anymore on my work. I held in my frustration until I couldn't anymore, so I confronted him about it in a joking manner. Even though I confronted him in a joking manner, I still said what I wanted to say. However, he apologized immediately and took my feelings into account, which I really appreciated. This is often a pattern for me, where someone annoys me until I can't hold it in anymore, but I can never say what I want to say with 100% seriousness, as I'm afraid it will spiral into an even bigger conflict or that people will think I'm overreacting.","A past experience that didn't involve any conflict would probably be when me and a friend went to the mall to hang out. This was around Halloween so we went to a Halloween store, walked through a few other department stores, then finally settled at a boba shop and talked for a few hours about stuff that was going on in our lives. I almost choked on a bug while I was there. After that, we went back to my house where we chatted a little more, and that's about all we did."
"My parents are very religious while I am not so most of the things I say (Mostly to my mother because my father is usually working) can't be said without ending in an really long ""debate"" that really is just my mother being stubborn while she calls me the stubborn one","Someone who commissioned me for art pushed to become my friend very quickly, so I decided to let him into my friend group. He's 25, which was a little strange since most of us are teenagers, but I thought he was cool. Turns out he was predatorial and kept trying to keep my partner in private calls with him. He blamed most of his behavior on autism, which could be a reason for his behavior but is still not an excuse to cause my partner the amount of distress he did so I had to make it clear to him we wouldn't be his friends."
"My father was not popular with the women in my family. He left the family when I was 8 years old. So I grew up surrounded by women who hated my father. But I look like my father, and we had many, many things in common. I did not know him well until my 20s, and now he is dead. But from the age of 8 to my mid-30s the women in my family said nothing good about him, and whenever they saw things in me that reminded them of him, they would bitterly lecture me not to ever be like him. But this agonized me. Recently, during a dinner with a few of those women present, now much older, I told them that they all damaged my sense of being a man, because I worshipped my father and they hated him, but even worse, they hated those parts of me that are like him. Instead of apologizing and listening with compassion, one of those women ‚Äì an aunt now in her 70s ‚Äì shouted at me, refusing to apologize. She shouted and shouted that he was a terrible man and that there were parts of me that were like him and that I should never forget that. I seethed with anger, and shouted at her back. The dinner ended in turmoil. I went home. I stopped communicating with her.","Six months after the above incident, long after that dinner, out of the blue that same aunt ‚Äì who I had ceased talking to ‚Äì texted me and profusely apologized and asked my forgiveness. This is a woman who s famous for never, ever, ever apologizing. I was stunned. It was a shock because it was so unlike her. I forgave her."
"That's too much to handle... When I was six years old, my father left without saying goodbye, his only reason being that he wanted to study Buddhism and save all sentient beings? It's disgusting. How can you save others when you abandon your own wife and children? I hated him ever since. My mother's sense of security was greatly affected by my father's sudden disappearance, and she became very worried about my safety and well-being, afraid that I might disappear too. I became a puppet controlled by my mother, unable to breathe freely. In both primary and high school, I was often bullied by classmates, although it was not so bad in middle school because my homeroom teacher favored me obviously. However, high school was really painful. I was constantly isolated by others, making me feel very uncomfortable. Even after I started working, I frequently encountered workplace bullying and sexual harassment. I don't like to argue with others, so I'm not good at debating and protecting myself. But I have always believed that kindness is not wrong, and I am not wrong. The problem lies with those who bully others, as their minds are twisted to do such things.","It's also a lot. Although I know my mother's love is twisted, I know she loves me. So I spent more than ten years communicating with my mother and letting her know my thoughts. Our values are very different, and we used to argue every day. I left home to work, and we argued on the phone. I roared out my heart, and she gradually began to hear and understand. In addition, I have friends who love and support me. They helped me and accompanied me during my worst depression. Most importantly, I met a very sunny and loving partner who is the sun in my life. I learned a lot of positive things from him. Without him, them, I wouldn't have lived until today."
"I was posting a response on an anti-racist friend's FB post about racism, and I basically said that anyone who is still racist must be retarded, and then they dragged me over the coals by reminding me that ""We don't use that word"" and I flew off the handle trying to defend myself. End-result: I lost that battle, and just don't ever use the word ""retarded"" anymore.","Snorgling my cat: he was curled up on my chest, and I was scritching his mottled fur, and he started literally licking my face, and it was awesome, lol."
